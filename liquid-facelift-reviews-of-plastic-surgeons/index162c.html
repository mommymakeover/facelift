<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The “liquid” Face Lift is a technique that involves the use of fillers such as Restylane, Juvederm, Sculptra, and chemodenervators such as Botox or Dysport to rejuvenate areas of the face. Some may add fat grafting or laser treatments as well.</p><p>Calling this a Face Lift is a bit misleading as the treatment provides rejuvenation by reducing wrinkles and plumping tissues as opposed to lifting sagging soft tissues which is accomplished with a surgical Face Lift.</p><p>This procedure will not lift sagging jowls, reduce a double chin, or fix a turkey neck.</p><p>By the same token, a traditional Face Lift will not correct crows feet lines, smokers lines, or enhance volume of thin lips.</p><p>Non-surgeons who can’t perform a Face Lift, attempt to capitalize on the results and popularity of the Face Lift procedure by using this title and performing other procedures (the Feather Lift) that claim to create surgical results without surgery.<br>

</div>In terms of safety, Face Lifts will have more risk as it is a surgical procedure, but in the hands of an experienced surgeon it is a safe, tried and true operation, with reproducible results.
<p>That is why it is still the gold standard of facial rejuvenation. Injectables are not without risk. Fillers can lump and cause infections, bleeding and bruising. Botox can relax muscles adjacent to those treated causing unwanted side effects.</p><p>No procedure, no matter how it is marketed is without risk. (Christopher J. Schaffer, MD, Birmingham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A liquid facelift refers to a procedure that uses fillers to mimic the results of a surgical facelift. There are pro’s and con’s that come along with this option, and it’s important to consult with a board certified physician to have your questions answered in detail.<br>

</div>There are areas that only benefit from surgery and issues that only benefit from fillers or fat grafting. That is why you cannot only rely on one modality of treatment if you want the best results possible.
<p>The results of a liquid facelift aren’t permanent which can be a benefit or a negative depending on how you look at it. Because fillers are being used to achieve the desired result, the outcome can be tweaked easily if necessary.</p><p>The downside to using fillers, is that it requires maintenance, whereas surgery offers a permanent or static result that will not change. Liquid facelifts require regular appointments to re-fill areas as necessary. Both procedures are safe as long as you are in the hands of a well qualified surgeon, however a liquid facelift is less invasive and requires less downtime.<br>

</div>The results are never going to be the exact same as having surgery, but my patients are always happy with the results of their injectable fillers. (Babak Azizzadeh, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<p><b>A Liquid Facelift is NOT REALLY a Facelift</b></p><p>A Liquid Facelift is a slick marketing term, coined by non-Plastic surgeons, which falsely suggest that it can produce similar results to a well done Facelift without the actual surgery. That is NOT the case.</p><p>In a Liquid Facelift, large amounts of Botox and fillers (Restylane / Perlane / Juvederm) are injected in the face to improve the signs of aging. When done well, in the right patients, a Liquid Facelift IMPROVES the appearance of facial aging. but – it does not come close to the facial rejuvenating effects of a well done Facelift which are MUCH better. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>It’s a catchy term that involves injections (fillers, botox, laser resurfacing, etc..). There is minimal downtime and it’s a great option for people who aren’t ready for a facelift or would like to have an idea of what some of the improvements are like.
<p>The reality is that although it’s cheaper than surgery at first, you’ll need to redo it in about 6-8 months to maintain the effect. If you are looking for a more permanent improvement, surgery will be necessary.</p><p>Otherwise, this is a great option and we all offer it to our patients. (Ricardo A. Meade, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A liquid facelift involves using dermal fillers, most commonly Restylane or Juvederm products, to restore lost volume to many areas of the face. This is a powerful tool that provides instant results that frequently last around a year.<br>

</div>The aging face is accompanied by volume loss and many time a simple replacement of this lost volume can takes years off the face. (Michael T. Somenek, MD, Washington DC Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<p>This is not a surgical face lift and will not give the same results or address the same concerns.  Liquid face lift involves combination of dermal fillers to restore volume loss and sculpting the face as well as some wrinkle relaxers, such as botox or dysport.</p><p>It gives instant results, virtually no downtime ( 3-5 day if bruising happens) and no scars and no pain.  You need an expert consultation to determine if you are candidate. </p><p>You need to ask yourself what bothers you the most, what kind of result you are looking for and what budget you have in mind.<br>

</div>Typically liquid face lift requires 4-10 syringes of dermal fillers and around 50-100 units of botox. It’s a great procedure and can take up to 10 years off your face instantly. (Anna Avaliani, MD, New York Physician)
<p>The procedure commonly referred to as a ‘Liquid Facelift’ is a non-surgical rejuvenation of the entire face (and sometimes neck) through the use of dermal and subdermal fillers, muscle relaxants and (occasionally) fat-dissolving injections. When performed in a carefully selected patient, this combination of volume replacement, muscle relaxant and slight redistribution of skin tension can create significant and very pleasing results with no ‘down-time’.</p><p>There are some significant limitations, however, to be informed of including: Excess skin and tension within the deeper tissues is not addressed with this procedure. For this reason the results are not comparable to the results of facelift surgery.<br>

</div>The products used in such procedures are not permanent (in the majority of cases – there are a few exceptions) meaning that maintenance and re-treatment are required in the longer term. I recommend consulting with a local, reputable aesthetic practitioner (plastic surgeon, aesthetic dermatologist or aesthetic physician) so that they can perform an examination, make a thorough assessment of your individual anatomy and provide further guidance (including discussion of realistic treatment outcomes) to help you make any treatment decisions. (Scott Ellis, MBBS, Adelaide Physician)
<p>Most doctors would consider a liquid facelift to be using large amounts of fillers and possibly adding some neuromodulators like Botox/Dysport/Xeomin to create significant rejuvenation of the face. A liquid facelift will not do the same things that a facelift can do, but can create some nice results in some patients.<br>

</div>It is important to remember that fillers and Botox are temporary, whereas surgical changes will last for many years and will have a permanent improvement, even though the aging process continues. (Matthew Richardson, MD, Frisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<p>A liquid facelift is absolutely safer than facelift surgery. You are completely awake during a liquid facelift and it requires no other anesthesia than topical cream and lidocaine in the filler itself. The results are excellent. (Morgan Rabach, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p><b>A technique for injecting advanced dermal fillers to lift and contour facial features.</b></p><p>A liquid facelift refers to the injection of various dermal injectables to lift and contour facial features. Dermal Fillers are a safe and effective solution for replenishing that volume and restoring skin to its youthful condition.<br>

</div>There are many quality fillers available today. Some of the top brands are Juvederm, Restylane, Teosyal, Redensity II, Voluma Lift and Volbella. These brands are all made of hyaluronic acid- which is already found in our body in our joints and eyes, therefore, the risk of an allergic reaction to hyaluronic acid is extremely rare.
<p>The duration of the fillers vary but in general last anywhere from 4 to 6 months for botox and hyaluronic acid fillers can last anywhere from 3 months to up to a year all depending on the type of product and amount used.</p><p>Dermal fillers are a great way to target areas of the face where wrinkle correction and facial rejuvenation is required and can provide good results that don’t require surgery. Most people choose a liquid facelift because they do not want to commit to a surgical facelift procedure but still want to achieve a youthful appearance.<br>

</div> Please see a board certified plastic surgeon who can take a look at the current condition of your face in order to create a customized non-surgical facelift procedure for you. (Cory Torgerson, MD, PhD, FRCSC, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<p>A liquid facelift is a non-surgical facial rejuvenation option for those who are not ready for surgery. The technique involves using injectable fillers to lift, sculpt, and smooth out the skin. Injectable fillers can help restore volume in selected areas and Botox can be used to help reduce fine lines.</p><p>However, injectable treatments have its limitations. A liquid facelift cannot address marked skin laxity or provide a long lasting solution. Surgical interventions are appropriate when the skin has lost elasticity and when longer lasting results are desired. (Julian De Silva, MD, London Facial Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>A liquid facelift is a combination of Botox and fillers that helps rejuvenate an aging face, smooth out wrinkles, and fill in areas of volume loss. The advantage of a liquid facelift is that there are no incisions, there is minimal downtime, and it is quick.
<p>The disadvantage is that results are not permanent and must be repeated, typically at least two to three times a year. (Lara Devgan, MD, MPH, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A liquid facelift is the use of a variety of injectable products, including Botox® and dermal fillers, to treat the signs of aging and create the appearance of a “facelift” without the need for surgery.</p><p>Different combinations of injections can be chosen depending on the desired result and the areas of concerns. Both are safe procedures, but a liquid facelift is not as effective as surgery. Also, fillers cannot treat excess skin that is best removed with surgery. (Vito C. Quatela, MD, Rochester Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>A liquid facelift involves injecting fillers into the face. The results are short term and the procedure needs to be repeated. You will not get the same results from a liquid facelift as a standard facelift. (Jeffrey Weinzweig, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Liquid face lift often includes fillers that are temporary. Fat transfers can last longer and give more volume however not knowing your skins condition it is hard to say what treatment options will be best for you. (Jeff Angobaldo, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i> Liquid facelift versus a traditional face neck lift</i></p><p>A liquid facelift involves injecting temporary fillers into the face to give it more volume. While fillers placed in the face do have some beneficial role, they’re not performing what a permanent facelift can accomplish.</p><p>The goal of a lower face and neck lift is to tighten loose facial and neck skin, tight and loose facial and neck muscles, tighten the jowls, and remove fatty deposits in the neck.

</div>A liquid facelift is the use of dermal fillers to restore the volume and support that is lost with the aging process. The amount of volume used is really dependent on the physical exam and the desired goal.
<p>I often use Sculptra in our practice in conjunction with the dermal fillers to achieve very natural and more rejuvenating look. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A liquid facelift involves injecting large amounts of filler in the face to restore facial volume and smooth out fine lines and wrinkles. It is not a true facelift because it is not a surgical procedure.</p><p>The results are temporary with repeat injections necessary to maintain results. To be sure what is best for you, see two or more board-certified providers in your area for a complete evaluation to make sure you are a good candidate and that it is safe for you to have treatment.
