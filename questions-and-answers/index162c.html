<strong>Removal of the sucking pad</strong>. The doctor reduces the size of the fat deposits located in the cheek area and returns harmonic proportions to the face. The volume of the operation and the procedure for its implementation are determined depending on the skin condition and the severity of gravitational ptosis, which can occur at any age.
<p>The possibilities of surgery allow performing a deep combined SMAS-lift (when the muscular aponeurotic layer of the face is first pulled up, and then the skin), which provides a more stabile and lasting effect. Due to the presence of endoscopic equipment is possible to perform operations and through the micro-incisions (1.5-2 cm) using special cameras, which provides the ability to track every movement of the tool on the monitor under the skin.</p><h3>Questions and answers about facelift (rhytidectomy):</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_197" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

<h4>What is the visual result of facelift?</h4><p>According to the experience of the doctors, after the intervention, the patients look on average 10 years younger. This effect is especially pronounced, if initially a person has thin skin, a thin face with an oblong form and high cheekbones.</p><h4>Do I need to do a facelift again?</h4><p>This is determined by your satisfaction with your appearance. There is no compulsory need for additional interventions in this case. Thanks to the professionalism of specialists, the overwhelming majority of patients have only one operation. If you want to repeat it, we recommend to do this no less that after 7-10 years.<br>

<h3>10 most frequently asked questions about facelift.</h3><h4>1.

It is believed, that patients, who underwent facelift surgery, look 7-10 years younger than their peers.
<h4>3. Best Age for First Facelift?</h4><p>There is no specific age for a facelift surgery. This desire can arise from 30 years to 80 years old. Endoscopic lifting of the forehead and eyebrows can also bring good results in younger patients, whose complaints are horizontal wrinkles on the forehead and drooping eyebrows. However, the best results of facelift can only be obtained from the patients with signs of aging. You can discuss your options with your surgeon to determine what is best for your individual case.</p><h4>4. What is being discussed at the consultation regarding facelift surgery?</h4><p></p>
