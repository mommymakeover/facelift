<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h4>Is Thermage affordable and can you benefit from it?</h4><p>Aging can have detrimental effects on the appearance of the skin. The presence of fine lines and loss of elasticity frequently increases with time. </p><p>Established cosmetic options like laser treatments, facelifts or retinoid creams are effective but may leave unattractive scars. </p><p>In recent years, a quick, noninvasive therapeutic approach called thermage has been devised. Thermage is an innovative dermatological procedure that treats wrinkles and sun damage by utilizing radiofrequency-generated energy to firm and smooth skin. </p><p>Results are astounding, and thermage cost is relatively low when compared to its cosmetic benefit. </p><p>Thermage treatments are usually between $1,000 to $5,000. Nevertheless, how does it work?</p><p>Thermage uses a dual-featured probe, which combines the production of powerful radiofrequencies with a cooling function to protect the epidermis. The procedure heats collagen within the skin for instantaneous firming, while simultaneously stimulating additional collagen production for more pronounced results over time.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2183" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>During the treatment, which may require up to two hours, a thermage probe transmits heat deep into the skin’s dermal layers while releasing a cool spray to protect the skin’s surface. Heat-generated tissue contractions in the deep layers of skin reduce epidermal lines and wrinkles, and the triggering of new collagen formation further enhances the firmness of the patient’s skin from deep within. The physician determines the level of heat used in the procedure and gauges the amount based on patient comfort and maximized results.</p><p>Although no surface damage is sustained, treatments are painful, and anesthesia, such as anesthetizing creams or intravenous drugs, is required. Pain medicines are typically indicated before the treatment to aid in minimizing discomfort. Other skin tightening procedures, such as dermal abrasion and laser-induced resurfacing, traumatize the skin’s surface and may cause scarring.</p><p>Thermage patients enjoy the benefits without the scarring. While general discomfort still ensues, thermage has progressed since its introduction and now produces better outcomes with less pain.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2184" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The lack of external trauma helps lower thermage cost and procedural risk. Side effects are extremely rare and usually resolve in a couple of weeks; they include swelling, blistering and reddening at the application site. Unlike facelift patients who have a recovery period of several weeks, thermage patients are often advised to resume work immediately.</p><p>Improvement to the texture and appearance of skin is generally noticeable immediately following treatment. Over the next several months, the skin becomes firmer and increasingly youthful. Treatment results remain intact for up to 24 months. Frequently, desired results are attained from the first treatment, but multiple treatments are sometimes beneficial. The physician advises the patient of what may be right for her.</p><h3>Patient Expectations With Thermage</h3><p>Though Thermage is a non-surgical treatment to tighten and rejuvenate skin, the patient still should know what to expect during and after the treatment. The procedure, it must be said, is expensive. Thermage cost for face are usually between $1,000 to $5,000. The patient should discuss these fees with their doctor before the treatment begins.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2185" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-f19c4ee415e49d8539c46bef1e0699a5">

</div><p>Unlike surgery, the Thermage treatment doesn’t require the patient to do anything out of the ordinary, like fast overnight. Blood and urine tests aren’t required, though it’s not indicated for pregnant women or if there’s a malignant lesion or suspicion of a malignant lesion in the area that’s going to be treated. People who wear pacemakers or similar implanted devices should also not have the treatment.</p><p>Generally, the patient wont need anesthesia. During the treatment, the patient feels a coolness on the area of the skin thats being treated, then a heating or pinching sensation that’s a sign that the treatment is working to break down the collagen in the lower levels of skin. This is what leads to the lifting and tightening of the skin. The patient may then feel another sensation of coolness. Another benefit of no anesthesia is that the patient can remain awake and let the doctor know what they’re feeling. This helps the doctor adjust the treatment to make the patient more comfortable and also lets them know that the treatment is working.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2186" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The facial treatment can last from about 45 minutes to an hour, depending on how much of the skin is being treated. Thermage can also be used on the abdomen, the buttocks, the legs and other places where the skin sags or bulges.</p><p>The patient who undergoes Thermage treatment can usually return to their usual routine right after the surgery, though they might want to rest a bit if it’s possible. Some patients might experience swelling or redness immediately after the treatment, but this will fade over a short time, usually within a day. They should continue with their usual skin regiment, or follow a regiment the doctor recommends. It’s important that they avoid too much exposure to the sun and use sunscreen.</p><p>The patient should see improvements in the look and feel of their skin right away. The improvements continue over a period of about two to six months and can last for years, depending on what type of skin the patient has, their exposure to sun, how their skin ages and other factors. While Thermage can be pricey, many patients are very satisfied with their outcome.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2187" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>The clinical efficacy of thermage</h3><p>It is a relatively new, non-invasive procedure used to treat wrinkles and aging skin. The procedure doesnt require any incisions. It is a procedure that can be performed on patients of all skin types. Sounds to good to be true? So the question is, does it work?</p><p>Unlike laser treatment, no damage is caused to the surface of the skin with Thermage. Unlike a facelift which has a two week recovery period, patients can return to work the same day when Thermage treatment is performed. In addition, unlike the facelift procedure, there are no scars with thermage and the skin tightening effects can last up to two years.</p><p>Thermage is a painful procedure that requires an anesthetic cream. Occasionally nerve blocks or IV sedation are required as well. There are newer protocols with thermage treatment that provide desired results with less power per treatment. The patient will experience brief, deep heating sensations to the skin as radiofrequency energy is delivered. Heating of the skin is required for tightening of the skin as collagen reaches effective temperatures. The physician controls the amount of energy delivered and will create a balance between comfort and maximum results. For maximum comfort, the heat works simultaneously with a cooling device to protect the outer layer of skin. An anesthetic lotion and/or pain medication may be prescribed to patients prior to the treatment for their maximum comfort.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2188" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-75d7779810e09cf26a6cf84d51e552cc">

</div><p>Thermage is a fast procedure. It can take anywhere from a few minutes up to an hour. However, sometimes additional time may be required to prepare the skin prior to the procedure.<br>
Immediate skin tightening is gained with thermage treatment. The skin will feel smoother, tighter and more youthful. Continuous improvement will be seen over weeks to months after treatment. Thermage results may last up to two years after the initial procedure.</p><p>Even though a single thermage treatment produces the desired effect for most patients, the surgeon will determine the course of treatment that is specific for each individual.</p><p>Thermage provides deeper energy in the skin than the typical laser skin therapy. It renews the contour of the face and provides healthier collagen of the skin.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2189" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>Eligibility of thermage varies from patient to patient. It is not suitable for everyone. It all depends on what the patient expects to achieve. Thermage is carefully considered by the plastic surgeon for each patient.</p><p>The plastic surgeon must first consider the patients skin laxity. Then the surgeon suggests what areas of the skin can be tightened up and renewed. Does thermage work for everyone? Yes, but Thermage works best for those under sixty years of age.</p><p>The procedure is also done for acne cases from moderate to severe. It cannot cure acne altogether. However, it can improve acne and prevent acne recurrence.</p><p>Wrinkles are formed as we all age. The human body produces less and less collagen as we age. The thermage procedure tightens the collagen. Once skin laxity is tightened, wrinkles lessen.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2190" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The Thermage procedure tightens skin with technology that heats the dermis layer of the skin and underlying tissue. Simultaneously, the epidermis layer of the skin is cooled continually. Heat to the collagen causes it to thicken.</p><p>This results in skin that is smoother and tighter. The body naturally responds to the heating of the dermis and underlying tissue with a response similar to the healing process and creates collagen within three to six months. This results in the long term tightening effects of the skin.</p><p>Thermage is a treatment that is considered cosmetic and is FDA approved. Thermage treatments can cost up to $2,000. However, only one session is necessary. Over the course of six months, results improve. There are some side effects with thermage. They include redness of the skin, blistering after treatment and minor swelling. However, these side effects are short term. They clear up quickly after treatment.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2191" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-ba102a33119689a43842b0af9a9f4c6b">

It tightens the skin around the eyes.</p><p>There is a new system called thermage Comfort Pulse Technology that is an advanced technology for skin contouring and tightening. This new system provides greater thermage results. It also provides greater comfort for the patient. Improved efficacy is gained by comfort pulse technology because of uniform heating to the skin. Increased tissue volume reaches more therapeutic temperatures.</p><p>Comfort Pulse Technology is performed using a sleek ergonomic vibrating handpiece to enhance patient comfort. The handpiece improves efficiency of treatment and is easy to use.</p><p>The patients comfort is clinically proven. Treatments were compared in over 40 patients. Comparisons were done with and without vibration.

</div>Smooth skin not only looks good but it also exudes a lot of confidence in the person and boosts self esteem. Currently the most commonly used treatment methods are ultherapy and thermage. I will look at ultherapy vs thermage for comparison purposes.
<p>The thermage procedure involves use of energy obtained from radiofrequency waves. This is shone on the skin and the heat produced is directed to the dermal collagen. After this, a cooler wave affects the dermis which traps the heat within it. This results in an instant contracture of the pre-existing collagen,hence flattens the wrinkles giving the skin a smooth and entirely new look. </p><p>After the initial treatment the skin improves gradually and eventually becomes stabilized as the amount of fresh collagen increases. During the procedure one does not experience any discomfort. Just a single treatment can last for more than 2 years hence it is a very effective method.</p><p>Ultherapy involves use of ultrasound to rejuvenate the skin. We cannot perceive this sound, but in this treatment it is directed to the dermis, which is the layer found below our skin surface. As a result, it causes a reaction in the cells thus they produce firmer new cells and collagen. The extra collagen is enough to support more skin and thus smooths out all wrinkles in the skin. This gives the skin a completely new and fresh look. The entire procedure usually takes one hour during which you might experience some little discomfort which clears immediately after the procedure. The skin gets a pink coloration which gradually fades after a few hours. One single treatment is enough to see the change in your face. The good thing about this procedure is that you will not require an aesthetic afterwards and it can be done on all skin types successfully.</p><p>Ultherapy has been unavailable for quite some time hence thermage has become the better option. The effectiveness of ultherapy in getting rid of the wrinkles is also inferior compared to the effectiveness of thermage. Thermage again tends to treat people of all ages while ultherapy is ideal for people who are in the ages between 30 and 50. Utterly, in terms of price consideration thermage is the better option. It is far much cheaper than ultherapy hence more economically available to people of all classes. In consideration of all, the question of Ultherapy vs thermage becomes a very simple question to answer.</p></div>
