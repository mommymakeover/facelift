<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Vampire facelift is probably one of the most non invasive facelift in the market right now. It was invented a couple of years ago and got its fame slowly due to its quick procedure and non invasive nature.</p><p>It is advertised that the effect of each vampire facelift treatment can only last for about 9 to 12 months and in order to prolong the rejuvenated effects, one has to receive reinforcement injections every year. Personally I think the time frame for each treatment is calculated in a general way and there should be many cases that can last for more than one year. Based on scientific researches, the main factors that will speed up the aging process are smoking and drug and alcohol abuse. Another factor is irregular sleeping hours and diets.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_695" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>All these factors will affect and shorten the effect of your vampire facelift. On the other hand, if you choose to exercise regularly and keep a healthy daily diet and regular daily work schedule, the effect of vampire facelift will definitely last longer than 12 months, maybe even 24 months or more.</p><p>And most importantly, being contented and happy with everything around you and take things easy will make a big difference on your appearances.</p><h3>Non Invasive Facelift vs Mini Facelift</h3><p>Sometimes its really difficult to make up your mind on if you should spend thousands of dollars on a facelift surgery to buy back 10 to 15 years of your age. And when you have finally made up your mind, exactly which facelift surgery to go for becomes another tough choice.</p><p>In the present facelift surgery industry, aside from the typical full facelift, there are another two very popular types of facelift surgeries Mini facelift and non invasive facelift.</p><h3>Differences of Non Invasive Facelift and Mini Facelift</h3><p>For non invasive facelift surgeries, there are no incisions and long healing time involved as it is done with only injections. Fillers of various types are injected underneath the face to tighten up the loose skin and erase off the wrinkles. Whereas a mini facelift requires small S shaped incisions which are well hidden. Vs. the non invasive facelift, a mini facelift requires a minimum of 7 to 10 weeks for the incisions to fully heal and there may be minor post surgery complications involved.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_696" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-c1bb3df51dd89060c70aa8397520f521">

</div><h4>Examples of Non Invasive Facelift and Mini Facelift</h4><p>One of the most popular non invasive facelift surgeries in recent years is called the vampire facelift. It is named in such a way because of its unique method of injecting a mixture of the patients own blood and a liquid called Selphyl back to their face.</p><p>It is very popular among people with busy work schedules due to the fact that it requires no healing time and the whole process only takes around 30 to 45 minutes to complete.</p><p>The very idea that it is using patents own blood as under skin fillers makes it less likely to cause complications and the blood will also act as a agent to promote collagen growth underneath the skin.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_697" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Beside the advantages of the vampire facelift, the down side of it is that it will need constantly reinforce injections to keep the youth effect every 9 to 12 months.</p><h3>The Quick Lift</h3><p>The Quick Lift is well known in the mini facelift category. It is a improved version of S-Lift which was invented 20 years ago. Designed for men and women aged between 40 to 65, the Quick Lift is able to significantly improve the appearance of lower to mid face as well as tightening the skin of lower neck to give patient a nice jaw line.</p><p>The advancement of Quick Lift is that it not only tighten the skin but also suspends the underlying tissues on a patients face, making the results last a lot longer than other types of mini facelift surgeries.</p><p>If taken care properly, the effect of a Quick Lift can usually last for about 3 to 5 years, depends on individuals lifestyles. Do note that smoking and alcohol addiction are some of the main factors that destroy your youthful look.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_698" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The disadvantages of a mini facelift is that it will take about 7 to 10 weeks for the incisions to fully heal and during which there might be complications like headache and swollen skin. And revision surgeries maybe needed if the incisions cannot heal properly.</p><h4>The cost of Non Invasive Facelift and Mini Facelift</h4><p>Both of the above mentioned facelift surgeries are very new in the plastic surgery industry. Hence as of the time of writing, the prices of which havent changed much since it was first introduced. However the list below will give you a rough idea of how much they cost.</p><p><strong>Vampire Facelift</strong>: 1000~1200 USD</p><p><strong>The Quick Lift</strong>: 2000~2800 USD</p><p>The costs varies a lot depending on which state you are doing the surgery in. The best way is still to give the plastic surgery center a call to find out the exact details.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_699" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Summary</h3><p>The above article is just to give you a brief idea and comparison of non invasive facelift vs mini facelift. Other than that, your plastic surgeon should be able to give you a more informative overview of the costs and various facelift surgeries which suits you better.</p><h3>Get Rid Wrinkles with Vampire Facelift</h3><p>Nothing is more frustrating than seeing yourself in the mirror every morning and find more and more wrinkles coming out due to the stress and irregular lifestyle that you are having day after day.

</div><p>The invention of vampire facelift has really made a lot of people happy. It is a non surgical facelift that is able to get rid of small wrinkles on your face within one 45 minutes to 1 hour. And it does not require any recovery time and hospitalization like many other traditional facelift surgeries. There are very little side effects involved with vampire facelift as there are no incisions required and the liquid filler used is a mixture of the patients own blood. For more detailed information about vampire facelift, please refer to how vampire facelift works.</p><p>Due to the fact that vampire facelift is a non surgical facelift and only local anesthesia is used during the 1 hour procedure, many high flying busy professionals love to go for a quick and painless facelift like this. They can choose to go for the non surgical facelift on Saturday and have a rest on Sunday and back to work on Monday.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_701" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">
