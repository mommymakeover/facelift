<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>There are numerous parameters that factor into how long it will be for each patient</p><p>First, it is important to realize that what a “facelift” means to a surgeon is usually different from what the lay public envisions.</p><p>When a surgeon is discusses a facelift, he is referencing a lower facelift i.e. a procedure that improves the jaw neckline. It does not address the midface, eyelids or forehead.</p><p>Therefore, the signs of surgery are typically limited to in front of the ears, the jaw and neck line.</p><p>In my experience over the years, swelling is not an issue. Rather, it is bruising. Again, when this occurs, it is usually in front of the ears and the upper neck.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2299" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Bruising can vary greatly from person to person, and variable factors such as you nutrition, age, underlying other medical factors all play into this.</p><p>With all this said, I advise my patients that the first 7 days it is reasonable to be out of the “spotlight” laying low. At day 7 all the stitches and half the staples in the hairline are removed.</p><p>If the patient doesn’t have extremely short hair, then typically with some makeup they are able to get back out to some regular activities, i.e. running to the grocery store, dry cleaners, etc… but still wouldn’t recommend doing regular social activities until day 12.</p><p>At that point the remaining staples are removed, and rarely have I seen a patient not be able to get back to their normal routine. If there is still some lingering bruising, the 529 nm wavelength will be used in the office which is extremely helpful in resolving the remaining bruising.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2300" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Again, swelling is not an issue in my hands. If other procedures are performed at the same time e.g. blepharoplasty, brow lift, those do not extend the recovery time from my experience. (Burke Robinson, MD, FACS, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The recovery time needed after a facelift in order to be in public is between 2-3 weeks for most patients. There is also an emotional recovery involved in that some facelift patients feel comfortable being in public much sooner than others.</p><h3>Recovery Day By Day</h3><p>Most surgeons have seen both ends of the spectrum. However, for the majority, the physical recovery from a facelift operation is rather quick.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2301" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Here is a breakdown of what to expect of a typical recovery:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Week 1</strong>– Increasing swelling the first 3 days, then stabilization and decreased swelling from its peak by the end of the first week. The small facial drains are removed in the first week.</li>
<li>
<strong>Week 2</strong> – Most bruising resolves by 10-14 days. Makeup can be used after around day 10 in women, and men can grow their facial hair as temporary camouflage. Significant decrease in facial swelling occurs in the second week.</li>
<li>
<strong>Week 3 to 4</strong> – Most facelift patients return to work and public life during this period.</li>
<li>
<strong>Week 6</strong> – May start regular exercise.3 months to 6 months- The redness of the scars reduce or will have disappeared.</li>
</ul><p>Most of the facial numbness will have resolved by the end of this period, although in some it may take longer. As the numbness resolves, so does the sensation of minor residual facial swelling. (Ramin Behmand, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In short, recovery after facelift varies from patient to patient. Most patients are rather swollen for seven days. At that time, sutures are removed, but incisions are still visible, so it is helpful when patients are able to camouflage the incision areas by wearing their hair down or wearing hats or scarves.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2302" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>By about two weeks after surgery, the majority of the swelling has resolved, but some of the tightness can last the better part of a month. By two weeks, most patients feel comfortable going out in public, but many choose to do so sooner.</p><p>Meticulous surgical technique, quality of sedation and anesthesia, and management of peri-operative blood pressure are essential factors in helping a patient to recover smoothly with minimal issues. Make sure to seek consultation with a board certified Facial Plastic Surgeon or general Plastic Surgeon. (Daniel J. Givens, MD, Dubuque Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Today Recover From a FaceLift “Instantly” or in “One or Two Days” in many cases</em></p><p>A facelift has evolved from an operation to refresh the face and neck to our chance to push the clock back a decade or two. The techniques are multiple and also have ranged from only a superficial skin pull back to full thickness pull back deep down to bone.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2303" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Today the leading technique involves a two layer facelift: either skin lift only with SMAS pull backs (plications, imbrications) with sutures OR two separate layers of skin and SMAS lifts, where the SMAS is a separate second layer (subSMAS, lamellar SMAS facelift -high,low).</p><p>The more surgery, the longer the healing time. But, above all, the skill of your surgeon dictates the time of recovery. The surgeon’s skill may be determined primarily from your surgeon’s credentials and the before and after photo galleryYour health is important as well, but an informed and talented surgeon knows how to modify his approach with different phases of his patient’s health.</p><p>Sometimes, non-surgical techniques can be optimized to simulate many of the key results for a facelift. In my New Jersey Medi Spa, only liquid facelift are provied using fillers with capability of lifting the skin and restoring your own body’s ability to make collagen, not far from the proverbial fountain of youth.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2304" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The result of medi spa non-surgical facelifts can be INSTANT in many cases, in qualified hands. With surgical techniques, In the past, like the subSMAS facelift , I usually told patients to expect 1-2 weeks before the swelling and bruising resolves.</p><p>The demand of today is for instant gratification. Surgery has kept up with the demands but with some hours of lag time. Currently, with special minimally invasive techniques involving minimal skin lift and SMAS modification with tried and true plication and imbrication, if the post operative instructions are followed , patients recover within 12 hours to two days in many cases with minimal to no swelling and bruising.</p><p>Some patients often want to return to desk positions or to their own companies within 1- 2 days to show off their new look.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2305" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The post op instruction is very simple: primarily leaving the dressing in place overnight , applying ice compresses, and resting with head elevated above the level of your heart for 12 hours and then for a few days until the risk for maximum swelling resolves, usually within 2-3 days.</p><p>Looking younger with minimal to no swelling and bruising at 12 hours doesn’t mean you haven’t had a major operation. The patient must still follow all the instructions for a few weeks, while enjoying her/his improved and more youthful appearance on select social occasions in a day or two after today’s minimally invasive facelift in expert hands. (Joseph M. Pober, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I typically tell patients to expect to take about 2 weeks off. There is expected swelling and bruising which can vary for each patient. However by 10 days to 2 weeks you can easily cover up any bruising with makeup.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2306" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The recovery is relatively easy from a pain standpoint, most patients report that they feel better than they look during the first 2 weeks after surgery. Another thing that I would say is that since most people make eye contact when they interact with you, patients are surprised that their friends and acquaintances often do not notice that anything has been done. (Catherine Weng, MD, Denver Otolaryngologist)</p><p>There are multiple stages involved in the recovery process for a facelift. Generally the majority of the recovery and healing takes place over the first week. During this time, patients should plan to minimize any rigorous activity or work.</p><p>During this period there will be a fair amount of bruising and swelling, though this varies from patient to patient. Its important to keep all of the incisions clean during this time period and usually an antibiotic ointment is applied 1-2 times daily.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2307" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-313fe935688988ae2e68b9ece196b42d">

</div><p>It is also important to maintain some type of a pressure head wrap which is worn around the head to support the tissues. This wrap is generally worn at night, but can also be worn throughout the day.</p><p>After the first week, most patients are able to return to a pretty normal routine. Gentle exercise is allowed. The bruising and the swelling basically subsides during the second week.</p><p>The body continues to heal the incisions over the next few weeks and months, though most of this is not visible and is taking place below the surface.</p><p>It is important to remember that there is a lot of variability from patient to patient regarding the degree of bruising, swelling and discomfort. Things that can be done to minimize and improve these issues include:</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2308" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</ol><p>(Robert Deeb, MD, Grosse Pointe Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Face lift recovery -should be rapid</h3><p>There is considerable variability in recovery to the point of being socially presentable. This is very much dependent on technique and details of management by a given surgeon. We see the average individual following a face lift being able to return to work and be very presentable often in under 1 week.</p><p>There is often very little bruising and generally minor/rapidly resolving swelling. In our practice the use of micro drains (often removed in 1-2 days) has virtually eliminated any consequential bruising. One needs to ask the surgeon about their experience and technique with these questions in mind. (Ludwig A. Allegra, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2309" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>We usually tell or patients to plan on about 2 weeks of down time with swelling and bruising. Many of our patients choose to take arnica to help reduce their healing time. You are allowed to start wearing makeup a few days after a facelift surgery, as long as you avoid the incisions.</p><p>That being said, I have patients who say they went out to dinner a few days after surgery, and others who spend the two weeks at home. (Susan D. Vasko, MD, FACS, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Recovery time following a facelift</strong></p><p>The recovery period following a face lift depends on a number of factors, the most important being the type of facelift being performed.

</div><p>However, wound healing continues for several months and final results are typically seen at 3-6 months. (Jacob Boeckmann, MD, San Clemente Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>This is an important concern for everyone. The recovery time varies depending on what type and how extensive of a facelift is performed. In our practice, a standard deep plane facelift typically takes about 10 days to 2 weeks to recover from, as long as no additional procedures are done.</p><p>ie. facial peels/ laser and as long as the healing is on course. All sutures and staples are removed at this point (10 days to 2 weeks), but there can often be ongoing swelling. For most patients, bruising has subsided and if any is left, this can be covered up with makeup.</p><p>We have had some patients feel comfortable going out in public at 1 weeks time, while some are still apprehensive at 10 days; however, a majority are usually comfortable at 2 weeks. Some of the variability is also based on how your heal and how much you bruise.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2311" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>If you easily bruise/ swelling, then expect to take a full 2 weeks off. On the other hand, if you rarely bruise and are a quick healer, you may be ready at 7 days. (Sapna A. Patel, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Facelift surgery requires about 2 weeks off from work</h3><p>Face lift surgery involves rejuvenation of the jowls and neck. It is not a particularly painful recovery, but you are swollen and bruised for about 10 – 14 days. I generally recommend that my patients take 2 weeks off from work.</p><p>You can see the my postoperative care instructions on my website. Also watch the video so understand more about facelift surgery. (Theda C. Kontis, MD, Baltimore Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Healing and Downtime</em></p><p>In my experience of over 1000 of my Signature RefresherLifts, most of my patients look presentable after 7-10 days. More days are needed if a chemical peel or dermabraison are done with the Signature RefresherLift. Most people look completely natural after 4-5 weeks. (Christian G. Drehsen, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2312" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p><strong>Generally need about 10 days</strong></p><p>The way this needs to be looked at is by looking at averages and probabilities. The probability is that by 10 days the majority of individuals who undergo a facelift will be reasonably presentable, and socially capable perhaps with some makeup needs.</p><p>A small percentage of patients required more time. One can go back to work at 7 days after the procedure in most instances. You shouldn’t schedule any important social events until weeks after the surgery. (David Q. Santos, MD, Bellevue Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Facelift recovery</h4><p>Recovery following a facelift, while somewhat variable depending on some the details of the individual operation, follows a fairly typical course. The first night following surgery, drains are in place and there is moderate swelling to be anticipated.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2313" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a93e47936855586b15a8f8c34ed2c8df">

</div><p>Drains and dressings are removed the following morning, and my patients are to gently wash their face and hair on post-op day 1. Swelling peaks at approximately 72 hours following surgery, after which time it rapidly improves, returning to ~90% of normal at around 2 weeks.</p><p>Discomfort throughout this process is minimal: most patients require no more than a few Percocet for pain relief in the first 2-3 days following surgery. Typically, patients return to work 7-10 days post-op. There may be some residual bruising in the neck, which is easily covered by makeup and also resolves by approximately 2 weeks. (Joshua D. Zuckerman, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Recovery after Face lift procedure is usually mild, bur requires some time. It is initially mild or moderate discomfort, swelling of the eyelids and other areas. I always apply a dressing to my patients faces to protect the entire area where the incisions have been made and ask them to sleep in “sitting” position.</p><p>Swelling, bruising is mostly gone by two weeks; usually patients need pain medications no longer than 2 -3 days postoperatively. On the 4th day they can wash their hair.</p><p></p>

</div>It is well known that the time of recovery depends a great deal on patients health and reaction of his body to the surgery; on the specific surgical techniques employed during the procedure; that’s why the range can vary from 2 to 7 weeks.
<p>However, most of our patients find that after about 2 weeks they are sufficiently healed to resume social activities.</p><ul>
<li>Restrictions include: smoking, any exercise or significant increase in heart rate – 2 weeks.</li>
<li>Time back to work with make up – 3 weeks.</li>
<li>Full effect – 3 months. (Ercan Karacaoglu, MD, Turkey Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ul><p>Recovery from a facelift depends on your selection of surgeon, your commitment on after care, and if you have any or no complications after surgery.</p><p>The usual course of recovery day by day after facelift is:</p><ul>
<li>*50% of the swelling is gone after 7 days,</li>
<li>*80% of the swelling is gone by 14 days.</li>
</ul><p>After 7-10 days most of the bruising of gone. Patients should be able to go out in public after 14 days without them noticing that they had surgery.</p><p>Others will be able to start to appreciate the positive changes of the surgery by this time.</p><p>I usually recommend patients to take at least 10 days off from work.
