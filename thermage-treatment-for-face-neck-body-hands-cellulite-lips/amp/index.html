<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Are you looking to diminish the appearance of wrinkles? Do you want an alternative to surgery? Do you have two spare hours? Thermage could be the solution for you.</p><p>Known as the “lunchtime face lift,” Thermage is a short, non-surgical procedure that works gradually over time.</p><p>Unlike surgeries where the effect is immediate or procedures that require many visits with minimal results, one Thermage treatment effectively diminishes the appearance of wrinkles over a six-month time frame.</p><p>Its popularity has been widely recognized by the media: Oprah and other programs have featured specials on the procedure. Thermage treatments are completely non-invasive: a session requires no scalpels or needles and leaves the patient with no bruising or swelling.</p><p></p>

</div>One session lasts approximately one to three hours with no additional downtime. Results are gradual and appear natural so you’ll never look like you’ve “had work done.”
<p>The skin and the tissue below are rejuvenated, leaving skin looking smoother and firmer, and you looking younger.</p><h3>Here’s how Thermage works:</h3><p>Controlled heat is applied to the collagen while the top layers of your skin are protected with a refreshing cooling spray. The heat causes the collagen in the lower layers to contract and your skin tightens immediately. </p><p>This effect continues for up to six months as the stimulated collagen continues to be revived and grow, rejuvenating your skin to give you a much more youthful appearance long after the procedure is over.</p><p>Because Thermage treats the collagen in the lower layers of the skin, it can be used on virtually any part of the body. It began as a facial treatment but has since grown into a rejuvenating treatment for the neck, abdomen, arms, legs, hands, lips, as well as to eliminate unwanted cellulite. Keep reading for more information about Thermage treatment options.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2078" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Thermage Treatments for the Face and Neck</h3><p>Are you just beginning to notice the signs of aging? Looking for the benefits of a facelift without the surgery?</p><p>A Face and neck Thermage treatment could be right for you.</p><p>Thermage is a non-surgical, non-invasive procedure that promotes the growth of collagen already present under the skin while encouraging new collagen formation.</p><p>For the face and neck regions, Thermage is perfect for patients who want tighter and younger-looking skin.</p><p>Some of the conditions Thermage treats include:</p><ul>
<li>Early jowling</li>
<li>Cheek folds</li>
<li>Sagging brow and eyelids</li>
<li>Loose skin</li>
<li>Acne scars</li>
<li>“Crow’s feet”</li>
<li>Wrinkles and creases around the eyes, nose and mouth</li>
</ul><p>Thermage works by emitting a specific radio frequency that heats the collagen cells below the skin’s surface. The immediate reaction to the heat causes the collagen cells expand, creating the appearance of fuller, younger looking skin on the surface. Unlike surgery, one Thermage treatment offers the added benefit of continuing to promote collagen growth and expansion for at least six months after the session.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2079" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>While not as extensive a treatment as a facelift, Thermage for the face and neck offers several advantages over a facelift procedure:</p><ul>
<li>Non-surgical</li>
<li>No downtime</li>
<li>Immediate results</li>
<li>Continued improvement over time</li>
</ul><p>The Thermage suite of procedures works on any type of skin on the body, but is perhaps best suited for the delicate face and neck area.</p><p>The FDA approved Thermage for the reduction of face and neck wrinkles in 2002, and since then over 20,000 procedures have been performed in the United States and Canada.</p><p>Because Thermage doesn’t involve surgery and results improve gradually you will never look like you’ve “had work done.” Initially you’ll look more rested and rejuvenated while results improve subtly over time.</p><h3>Body by Thermage Treatments</h3><p>In 2002 the FDA approved the Thermage system for reduction of wrinkles on the face and neck. The response was so positive that in 2006 the Thermage suite of treatments received additional FDA backing for use over the entire body. The resulting product was Body by Thermage.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2080" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The best candidates for Body by Thermage treatments are people with loose body skin. New mothers who have an excess of skin after pregnancy make great candidates. People who have just experienced considerable weight loss resulting in loose skin are also excellent candidates for Body by Thermage, as well as older patients unhappy with the natural loosening of the skin that accompanies aging.</p><p>Other typical applications for Body by Thermage procedures are lax abdominal skin, “bat wing” arms and sagging thighs and buttocks. In all cases, Thermage treatments offer a quick and long-lasting alternative to surgical procedures.</p><p>The Thermage system works by emitting a radiowave into the lower layers of the skin while the top layers are cooled with a rejuvenating mist. The radio waves heat the collagen cells under the surface of the skin, causing them to expand and the skin above to take on a firmer and more youthful appearance.</p><p>A positive side effect that accompanies the heating of the collagen cells is the wounding of the collagen, which heals and regenerates for the next six months and prolongs the tightening effect.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2081" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In comparison to a surgical procedure, Body by Thermage has many advantages. Perhaps the most positive aspect of Body by Thermage is the relative absence of downtime.</p><p>Patients can typically return to their daily lives immediately following the procedure, experiencing only minor swelling and redness.</p><p>Unlike surgical procedures, the results of the Body by Thermage procedure are gradual and improve over time. With Body by Thermage results are immediate and the healing of collagen cells prolongs the rejuvenating effect of the procedure.</p><h3>Thermage for Hand Rejuvenation</h3><p>Plastic surgery treatments for the hands are the latest trend in plastic surgery, as the hands are a telltale sign of a person’s age. But the skin on the back of the hand is delicate and fragile, so treating it requires skill and care. Fortunately a new procedure has revolutionized hand care for patients in search of fewer wrinkles and a more radiant skin texture.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2082" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-34472a33856e140ff0bbe7104c389084">

</div><p>Hands by Thermage is perfect for patients who want younger looking hands without the downtime that comes with surgery and injections.</p><p>One of the suite of Body by Thermage offerings, Hands by Thermage is a non-invasive procedure that drastically improves the youthful appearance of the hands by encouraging collagen growth in the lower layers of the skin.</p><p>Patients have been delighted that such a quick and long-lasting remedy is available. Hands by Thermage offers patients the benefits of a surgical procedure without the invasiveness or downtime.</p><p>Hands by Thermage works by using microwaves to promote new collagen growth in the lower layers of the skin in the hands, taking advantage of elastic properties of the skin. This new and improved collagen encourages a thicker and smoother appearance on the outside of the skin. The procedure is an ideal treatment for “thin and crinkled” skin on back of the hands.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2083" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>A Hands by Thermage procedure takes approximately 30 minutes, after which the patient enjoys immediate results with no downtime. Results continue to improve over the next six months as new collagen forms.</p><p>The best part? Hand rejuvenation treatments with Thermage require just one treatment with no surgery, no injections, and no downtime.</p><h3>Thermage Cellulite Treatments</h3><p>Are you among the nearly 90 percent of women who experience cellulite? Do you have cellulite that will not seem to go away despite diet, exercise and over-the-counter medications?</p><p>Are you too busy to have surgery with extended recovery time? A Thermage Cellulite session could be the answer for you.</p><p>Thermage recently introduced its revolutionary cellulite solution to the market after nearly two years of clinical development and trials. The treatment works by heating the collagen cells under the skin to rebuild existing collagen and improve blood flow to smooth the skin’s surface. Clinical trials have shown that Thermage technology reduces the appearance of cellulite after a single treatment.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2084" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>Thermage Cellulite treatments are cleared by the FDA and require no surgery, needles, or downtime of any kind.</p><p>Other non-invasive cellulite procedures require multiple sessions in order to be effective. Thermage Cellulite, however, reduces dimpling on the buttocks and thighs after only one treatment. As with all Thermage procedures, results are evident immediately and the skin continues to improve in quality for up to six months after the procedure.</p><p>Perhaps the best aspect of a Thermage Cellulite treatment is the absence of recovery time. Patients can return to work immediately after treatment. No surgery, injections or downtime is required.</p><p>All Thermage procedures work by directing a specific radiofrequency to heat the layers of tissue beneath the skin’s surface. By heating the collagen cells below the skin, Thermage encourages collagen growth by taking advantage of the skin’s elasticity to produce a firmer appearance to the skin.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2085" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Your plastic surgeon will take steps to alleviate the slight discomfort caused by the procedure. Most often a numbing cream and a refreshing cooling mist applied during the procedure ensure that you are as comfortable as possible during your Thermage treatment.</p><p>So far nearly a half million patients worldwide have received treatments using Thermage technology to stimulate the existing collagen and encourage the growth of new collagen. Unlike other procedures whose results are immediate yet diminish over time, Thermage technology continues to promote collagen growth after a treatment, making multiple sessions unnecessary.</p><h3>Thermage for Lip Enhancement</h3><p>Looking for a way to increase the fullness and definition of your lips without injections or downtime?</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2086" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Lips by Thermage is part of the Body by Thermage suite of procedures that is revolutionizing traditional plastic surgery. Just like all Body by Thermage treatments, Lips by Thermage works by sending radio waves that immediately expand the collagen below the top layer of skin while encouraging continued collagen production for months afterwards. Patients’ results include increased lip definition and the reduction of fine lines.</p><p>Unlike injections, surgery and other short-term solutions, Lips by Thermage provides immediate results that increase in effectiveness with time. Injections can be painful, costly, and must be repeated every three to nine months. Surgery, while effective, requires a large amount of downtime post-operation.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2087" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Lips by Thermage, however, is non-invasive with no downtime and the results continue to improve for up to six months after the procedure.</p><p>During clinical evaluations, patients receiving Lips by Thermage treatment found:</p><ul>
<li>The lips had a much fuller and defined appearance</li>
<li>Fine lines and wrinkles decreased</li>
<li>The skin above their lips was smoother and softer</li>
</ul><p>In addition to a younger-looking appearance, Lips by Thermage patients experienced practical benefits as well. Patients reported a decrease in problems with their lipstick running, and also found it easier to apply lip liner.<br>
According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, lip filler treatments increased by approximately 20,000 procedures in 2006. Because of the importance of younger, fuller looking lips in overall appearance, lip treatments are one of the fastest-growing areas of plastic surgery treatments.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2088" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Lips by Thermage, like all Body by Thermage procedures, employs a unique radio frequency technology to encourage new collagen growth by stimulating and tightening existing collagen cells. During treatment your plastic surgeon will ensure your comfort by applying a cooling mist to the top layer of skin while treating lower-level collagen cells with rejuvenating radio waves.</p><p>Patients see results from a single treatment with no downtime. Unlike injections or surgery, results are natural looking, subtle and improve over a period of two to six months.</p><p>Because Thermage is a delicate procedure involving sensitive areas of the skin it should always be performed by a trained medical professional working under the supervision of a medical doctor, preferably a plastic surgeon with experience in anti-aging techniques.</p></div>
