<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The cost of a facelift depends on the geographic location, the type of facelift needed, your surgeon’s credentials, his revision rate, and your surgeon’s experience and reputation.</p><p>Facelifts can range from $5500-$25000. Not all facelifts are the same and every person has a different facial anatomy and the approach for a facelift has to be individualized.</p><p>Many surgeons refer to a Facelift as only the lower part of the face, others include the brow and eyelids as part of their facelift. For example, we specialize in Natural Facial Plastic Procedures such as our Natural Facelift and Natural Necklift to provide patients with a natural appearance to their face after surgery.</p><p>Though our facelift costs are similar to others in our area, we provide and offer different types of lifts than they do.</p><p>Asking to look at before and after photos may give you an idea of the surgeon’s aesthetic judgement and how natural his or her facelift results are.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3542" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>It’s a good idea to find 3 plastic surgeons who specialize in facial procedures and visit all three to see who connects with you the most. Picking the right surgeon the first time around is worth the cost of a well performed facelift. (Mike Majmundar, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost is dependent on the specific type of facelift procedure that is done, as well as other associated aesthetic procedures that are often done at the same time.</p><p>Some procedures can be done under mild sedation, while others are better performed under general anesthesia. This will affect the cost. The cost of a facelift also varies greatly between geographic areas. A reasonable price range would probably be between $7000 and $13,000.</p><p>If you have several consultations and you’re comparing prices, I recommend that you ensure that you are comparing apples to apples.</p><p>As a last word of advice, go with the plastic surgeon who you’re most comfortable with and not necessarily the lowest price. (Erik Miles, MD, FACS, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3543" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-15e7e8636cd6e680fe4d499b97f82b68">

</div><p><i>Expect to hear a range from $7500-$15000 </i></p><p>It will all depend on severity of your facial changes. No two facelifts are alike. Quality will always cost. Beware of cheap price. Cost also varies from region to region. I am giving you a range of cost in Dallas.</p><p>I will expect Seatle to be comparable. (Vasdev Rai, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Facial surgery costs</em></p><p>The term facelift can be tied to a very specific type or procedure or can represent a catch-all term for facial surgeries. Different facial surgery procedures can be done in isolation or as a combination of procedures and each procedure can help to address individualized concerns with the face.</p><p>The total cost of a facial surgery can vary immensely depending on what combination of procedures are considered. The range can be anywhere from 8,000 to 25,000 dollars. For example, a lower facelift can be combined with a neck lift, eyelid lifts (upper and lower), brow lift, mid face lift and fat grafting procedures.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3544" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-69d878c2edf505f6450abc6b78aa38f5">

</div><p>Each of these can add time and costs to the procedure. Staying a night or two in the hospital will also contribute to the cost. Further there are some great non-surgical procedures such as laser resurfacing that can help further optimize your results and be added to your procedure in a staged fashion or at the time of surgery.</p><p>More important than the cost, however, is finding the right surgeon for you and help you assess your concerns and develop an appropriate surgical plan of care for you. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Costs of a facelift</strong></p><p>I often tell my clients that a full facelift or even a “lower facelift” can be life changing. The part that I play as the surgeon is only the tip of the iceberg. The postoperative facelift patient has a lighter bounce in their step and a more confident demeanor and attitude.</p><p>It is truly the only procedure that has this effect so predictably. Please don’t search out the cheapest or most expensive surgeon. You should go on at least 3 consultations and meet the actual surgeon and look at before and after photos.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3545" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-c7b3e0b9854ed013c1592278f6f706f4">

</div><p>You can even ask to speak to a previous patient if you’d like. The costs should run between $8000-$15000 dollars depending on what procedures you will need. (Nicolette Picerno, MD, Denver Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Cost of a Facelift in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada</strong></p><p>I figured I’d update this question as it is very popular. Obviously there is a wide range of costs depending where you are in the world. In my City, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, a facelift can cost anywhere between 6000-12,000 depending on where you do it.</p><p>This is a typical cost in this area. I’ve also included an article discussing facelifts that I wrote and what to expect here in Ottawa. Dr James P. Bonaparte, MD, MSc, FRCSCOtolaryngology – Head and Neck SurgeryFacial Plastic and Reconstructive SurgeryOttawa, Ontario, Canada.

</div><p>Price range can vary greatly by geographical location and whether it is done under GA and whether you stay in the surgical facility overnight. With a general anaesthetic and overnight stay, it can easily cost between 12k-18k in Toronto. Some practices charge upwards of 25K. (Asif Pirani, MD, FRCS(C), Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Ultherapy procedure vs. facelift in Los Angeles</h3><p>Not all facelifts are the same; and vary depending on the depth of surgery and pull. An alternative to a full facelift is the non surgical Ultherapy procedure. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>The Average Surgeon Fee for a Facelift is $6,607.00 </em></p><p>If you are considering facelift surgery it is very important that you consult with plastic surgeons comprehensively trained in all types of facial cosmetic procedures. As you explore prices across the country you will find that the cost for different types of cosmetic procedures varies from one geographic location to the next.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3547" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You will also find that it will vary from doctor to doctor. Additionally, there are several different types of facelift procedures. Some procedures are more invasive than others and take more time to perform. These procedures will cost more than a less invasive procedure that requires less time to perform.</p><p>Recent statistics published by the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery report that the average surgeon fee for facelift is $6,607. This does not include a charge for using the facility nor does it include any associated anesthesia charges.</p><p>In general, you should expect to hear ranges between $6,000 and possibly upward to $20,000. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>For example if a 60 year old woman goes to an experienced face lift surgeon she may receive a shocking face lift estimate of $25-30k but this will include:</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3548" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Depending on the amount of work that is necessary, this may be done as an outpatient surgery. (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Facelift fees</strong></p><p>When considering facial rejuvenation procedures, the doctors credentials and experience should be a paramount concern, followed by your rapport with the surgeon. Select a surgeon that explains answers to your questions thoroughly and with adequate explanations.</p><p>Fees should only be compared for like procedures, and between surgeons with the same experience level. Most patients who see me after a facelift who are disappointed shopped for price instead of an experienced surgeon, and they all regret it. (Patti A. Flint, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Facelift cost in Beverly Hills vs New York City</strong></p><p>The cost depends on your anatomy and your goals. The cost can vary widely. I can tell you that when I do Facelifts in NYC the cost is higher to the patient by several thousand dollars when compared to Beverly Hills simply because the NYC anesthesiologists that I use charge about double what the Beverly Hills Anesthesiologist charge and the operating rooms that I have used charge about 25-30% more in NYC.

</div><p><em>Cost of Face Lift varies by region and definition of Face Lift</em></p><p>The first step is to determine what about your appearance you wish to change. Then see one or two surgeons and compare notes on the recommended procedures. I try to provide accurate quotes to my patients in a menu format and allow them to select the procedure(s) they wish to address their most dreaded problem areas.</p><p>However, it is common for a patient to say, “well since the lower lids are only $2,500, I’ll go ahead and do that, too.”, for example. Lower eyelid surgery is not included in our definition of “face lift”, but knowing the menu allows for educated selecting.</p><p>In the surgeon’s terms, “face lift” really indicates the jowels along the jaw line. My fee for this is less than a “Full Face / Neck Lift”, which I use to indicate to my office and OR staff and the patient that I will be making a longer incision into the hair line and working in the neck as well.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3554" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I use another term, “Submentoplasty” to tell the OR staff that we will be making a separate incision under the chin and utilitzing liposuction, etc. to contour the “submental” region. A patient might easily think that “face lift” includes all of these, when in reality, they have separate charges, which I frequently discount if being performed together, etc.</p><p>So in the end, it’s like shopping for a car; you simply need to figure out what you want, what you’re willing to spend, then find someone who can deliver the desired procedures for your price range.</p><p>Realize that the anesthesiologist and surgical facility also charge fees that factor into the total patient cost as well. Unfortunately, these are out of your surgeon’s control in many cases, but nonetheless must be passed on to the consumer–you.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3555" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-992609270e15a3489b1d710341d52188">

</div><p>As long as you are satisfied with the results, you won’t regret spending the money, and the key to satisfaction is realistic expectations. Don’t bargain hunt for something of this magnitude. (David M. Mills, MD, FACS, Pensacola Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>It depends on exactly what you want.</h3><p>For most plastic surgeons, it depends on how much work they have to do. How much of a lift-a mini lift or a full lift. Will the cords in the neck be removed? Will you need a cheek lift as well? See what I mean.</p><p>See an experienced plastic or facial plastic surgeon and get a few opinions. It will be well worth the investment. Don’t be misled by infomercials with catchy names. It is your face. (Toby Mayer, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Go for a few consultations: price of a facelift</em></p><p>There are many factors that go into this and it would be difficult to give you any ranges. It would kind of be similar to asking how much does a house cost? Most people think a face lift includes the forehead, upper and lower eyelids, cheeks, chin, ears, and neck as well as the skin.</p><p>In reality, these are all different and not necessarily included in the cost of a facelift. Some procedures may take as little as one and a half hours while others may take as long as 8 hours.</p><p>Depending on some of these factors, surgeons fees (excluding operating room, anesthesia, implants, meds, etc) would begin at 3000 but proceed up to 25000. This is not a very exact range and it is probably not very useful to you.</p><p>I would suggest you begin by going for a few consultations. You will learn alot. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Cost of a full face/ necklift</em></p><p>The cost of a full face and neck lift is determined by 3 components: these are surgeons fee, anesthesia physicians fee, and operating room fee. It is important to shop quality, not price since this is your face.</p><p>Look for a board-certified surgeon who performs lots of Natural appearing facelift procedures, board certifications, ratings reviews, testimonials, and most importantly their before and after photo gallery.
