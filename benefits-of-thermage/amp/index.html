<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Thermage treatment is an increasingly popular cosmetic procedure designed to reduce the signs of aging by stimulating collagen production and tightening the existing collagen in the skin. If you want to learn more about Thermage, keep reading:</p><p><strong>What are the benefits of Thermage treatment?</strong> Thermage treatment is a safe procedure that has been proven to help tighten and contour the skin, producing younger-looking and smoother skin. This type of treatment is minimally invasive and requires virtually no recovery time.</p><p>Plus, it can be used to treat people of all skin types. There is no surgery required or abrasive tools needed, which means you can achieve naturally younger-looking results in a short period of time.</p><p><strong>What can I expect from a Thermage treatment?</strong> During your Thermage treatment, your cosmetic specialist will use a hand-piece that features a smooth, flat tip to apply radio frequency technology to the skin.</p><p>The radio frequency safely heats the dermal layer of the skin where collagen is produced. The heat stimulates collagen production, which can provide even skin tone, reduce drooping skin, and prevent the development of wrinkles. An increase in collagen production can also renew youthful contours of the skin and improve the smoothness and texture of the skin’s epidermis layer, or surface.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2025" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-5729eadb6841f812a47a108d82e9cd34">

</div><p><strong>What can I expect after a Thermage treatment?</strong> Directly after your Thermage treatment, you’ll notice minor improvements in the texture of your skin. Within weeks, collagen will begin to regenerate, leading to tighter skin that looks younger, more evenly toned, and smooth. Results will be influenced by the areas of your skin that you have treated.</p><p>For example, if you undergo a Thermage treatment around your eyes, then you’ll experience reduced eyelid hooding and look less tired and aged. Thermage can be applied to nearly every area of the body. If you have wrinkled or sagging skin or cellulite, then a Thermage treatment can help tighten skin, reducing wrinkles, drooping, and dimpling.</p><h3>Thermage For Men</h3><p>All the positive attributes are there of the treatment. There is such little down time, its a relatively fast, painless procedure, and the results are very natural – I think that’s one of the things that really attracts men.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2026" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-a7a839d44366153014a3b66711350c40">

</div><p>The majority of men who are doing this don’t want to look over done, they don’t want to look like they’ve had a face lift, but at the same time they want to look young, they want to look youthful, they want to look vigorous.</p><p>In today’s job market there is so much competition – especially for high level professionals on Wall Street, attorneys, people in advertising – that a youthful look is now becoming as important for men as it is for women.</p><p>I think its becoming very common for men to be very concerned about their appearance and now that they know that they have something they can use that’s non-invasive I think they’re getting really excited about it and I think once more of the word comes out about Thermage CPT you’re going to see many more men taking advantage of this skin tightening opportunity.</p><p>While plastic surgery can help to rejuvenate your appearance and reduce the signs of aging, a number of individuals would prefer a non-invasive treatment method. Thermage is the perfect non-invasive solution.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2027" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-614c45bb03f5a1ab883cf69378a6c227">

</div><h3>The Benefits of Choosing Thermage</h3><p>Delaying and minimizing the appearance of aging is a major concern among people all across the nation. Perhaps that is why so many procedures exist that focus on restoring youthful skin and reducing wrinkles. Yet out of all of the procedures available, Thermage treatment is the only option that is both non-invasive and fully effective. Here are some of its benefits:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>No Special Preparations</strong>. When you undergo Thermage treatment, the only action you need to take is to block off the appointment time on your schedule and drive to the doctor’s office.</li>
<li>
<strong>Little or no Recovery Time</strong>. Since Thermage is non-invasive, you can resume your daily activities upon completion of your session. There is no bruising, injection site, or anesthesia to recover from.</li>

</div>
<li>
<strong>Naturally Rebuilt Collagen</strong>. Thermage works by stimulating the natural production of collagen, which is responsible for the vibrancy and elasticity of your skin. While other procedures work by camouflaging the effects of reduced collagen, Thermage gets to the root of the problem to correct it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Effective Treatment for All Skin Types</strong>. Thermage is effective on all skin types and tones. Since there are no incisions, it is a perfect treatment for skin types that are prone to heavy scarring. Thermage is also ideal for anyone who wants to restore his or her youthful appearance without leaving evidence of the procedure.</li>
<li>
<strong>No Limitations on Treatment Areas</strong>. Thermage isn’t just for the face – it can rejuvenate the skin on any area, and can even help to contour and shape the body. Thermage has even been shown to be beneficial in reducing the appearance of stretch marks!</li>

</div><h3>How to Prepare Yourself for a Thermage Treatment</h3><p>If you are starting to notice wrinkles, sun spots, and other undesired changes on your face or neck, you may be wondering if there are effective non-invasive treatment options available. Thermage treatments can bring dramatic changes to your skin without you ever having to undergo surgery or have anesthesia. Here are some tips to help you prepare for a Thermage treatment:</p><h4>Find A Doctor</h4><p>You’ll need to find a doctor who is qualified to perform the Thermage treatment. You can ask your friends for recommendations, or ask your primary care physician for a referral to a trusted doctor. You don’t want to risk your skin and its care to someone who isn’t experienced or trained in the proper application of Thermage treatments.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2030" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h4>Do Your Research</h4><p>Ask friends who have had Thermage what they thought about it, and where they found their pre-consultation information to discuss with their doctor. Choose websites that are trusted medical sites for your information, and stay away from sites that only offer opinions, or only offer one side of the story. Use this information to make a list of questions to ask your doctor.</p><h4>Attend A Consultation</h4><p>Schedule an appointment with your doctor to meet with him or her face to face. This will allow your doctor to examine the area you want treated, and provide you with a chance to ask any questions you may have. Make sure to discuss your desired results and what you can expect from Thermage treatments.</p><h4>Get Ready</h4><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2031" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Make sure you have purchased any special items you may need for after the Thermage treatments, including lotions or creams. During your consultation, your doctor will mention any special considerations for after your treatment, including resting, staying out of the sun, and your diet.</p><h3>What To Expect When You Receive A Thermage Treatment</h3><p>Thermage is a non-invasive cosmetic procedure that can help contour, tighten, and smooth skin in order to create a more youthful appearance. Thermage works by transmitting heat energy throughout the deep, collagen-rich lower layers of your skin. This heat tightens existing collagen and stimulates the formation of new collagen. Read on to learn what you can expect during a Thermage treatment:</p><p><strong>Pre-Treatment Consultation</strong>: When you meet with your physician, you will be able to discuss your desired areas of improvement. Together, you and your doctor can determine what results can be expected and whether you are a good candidate, as well as how long the treatment may take.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2032" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p><strong>Experiencing Thermage</strong>: Thermage treatment is a relatively short process that takes an average of 45 minutes for the face and an hour and a half for other parts of the body. The length of time needed to complete the process depends on the size, location, and condition of the area.</p><p>During the procedure, your practitioner will place a small, hand-held device against your skin on the area to be treated. Each time the heat device touches your skin, you will feel a brief, cooling sensation, then a deep but short heating sensation, and finally another cooling sensation. Your physician will always ask for feedback on the level of heat used in order to balance your comfort with maximum results.</p><p><strong>After Treatment</strong>: Thermage is a gentle, one-time procedure that requires no recovery time. Although your skin may be slightly red immediately following treatment, this should disappear within 24 hours. Results will develop in the two to six months after treatment, as your body renews the skin’s underlying collagen. Depending on your age and the condition of the skin that’s treated, Thermage can last for years.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2033" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Signs that Getting a Thermage Treatment is the Perfect Decision for You</h3><p>Thermage CPT is a revolutionary procedure designed to help tighten and re-contour the skin without the need for surgical incisions. Continue reading to learn whether the Thermage CPT treatment is right for you.</p><h4>You Are Suffering from Fine Lines and Wrinkles</h4><p>Thermage treatment may be the perfect solution to meet your needs if you are suffering from facial lines, wrinkles, or loose skin. Unlike chemical peels and other non-invasive treatment options, Thermage CPT can be performed on all skin types and on nearly any area of the body.</p><h4>You Do Not Want to Undergo Surgery</h4><p>Thermage CPT does not require the use of anesthesia, as it is a non-surgical treatment option. Treatments are performed using a hand-piece to deliver radiofrequency waves through the skin. These radiofrequency waves safely heat the deep layers of your skin—tightening existing collagen and stimulating new collagen production to improve the texture and smoothness of your skin.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2034" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h4>You Do Not Have the Time for Multiple Treatments or an Extensive Recovery</h4><p>Individuals who do not have time to undergo multiple anti-aging treatments are ideal candidates for Thermage CPT. Most patients find that their body contours are improved with just a single treatment. Facial treatments typically take 45 minutes, while treatment on other parts of the body may take up to an hour and a half, depending on the size of the area and the condition of the skin. Thermage CPT may also be the right decision if you are unable to take time off of work for recovery, as the treatment requires no down-time and does not cause bruising.</p><h3>How to Prevent Cellulite after Your Thermage Treatment</h3><p>Cellulite is composed of small portions of fat that press against your skin from beneath, creating a dimpled look.

</div><h4>Quit Smoking</h4><p>Smoking has many detrimental effects on the body, including damaging the skin. Habitual smoking promotes early aging and dehydration. Both of these factors affect the look of your skin and the health of your skin’s connective fibers.</p><h4>Stay Hydrated</h4><p>Hydration is extremely important for healthy skin. Drinking enough water and eating hydrating foods each day can help prevent the formation of cellulite. In addition, well-hydrated skin is plumper and better able to repair itself than dry skin. Staying hydrated will help keep you looking young and healthy after your Thermage treatment.</p><h4>Exercise Often</h4><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2036" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Exercise is great for all parts of your body, including your skin. Cellulite tends to form on the lower body as a result of long periods spent sitting in a chair. Activity promotes a healthier circulatory system, which reduces the risk of cellulite development. Exercise also helps maintain a healthy body weight and build muscle, which reduces the appearance of cellulite. Being active doesn’t require spending long hours at the gym—simply take frequent walks during the day or take the stairs rather than the elevator to promote healthy skin.</p><h4>Eat a Healthy Diet</h4><p>A healthy diet that is rich in nutritious, lean foods promotes a healthy weight and better circulation. Incorporate heart-healthy foods, such as avocado and salmon, into your diet and choose lean snacks, such as vegetables or fruits, to help keep your entire body looking great.</p></div>
