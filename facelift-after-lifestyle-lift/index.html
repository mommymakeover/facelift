<span itemprop="articleBody"><p>A facelift can be perfectly done after a &#8220;Lifestyle Lift&#8221; or any other type of facelift is done. Facelift is a procedure that rejuvenates the face, but does not stop the aging process. It is common that a second or a third facelift is performed in somebody&#8217;s lifetime every 7 to 15 years.</p>
<p>Patients interested in a re-do facelift (secondary facelift) should make a consultation with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon specialized in face lifts (John Mesa, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>It is actually very common to see patients in my office requesting a full face lift and neck lift after not being satisfied with their results from a life style lift and/or the results did not last the time as expected.<br />
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3429" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 160px"><meta itemprop="width" content="150"><meta itemprop="height" content="200"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/06/A-Few-Days-And-Up-To-A-Week-To-Recover-150x200.jpg" alt="A Few Days And Up To A Week To Recover" width="150" height="200" class="size-medium wp-image-3429" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A Few Days And Up To A Week To Recover</p></div>A consultation and examination will determine if you have laxity in the skin and would be a good candidate to move forward with another procedure. (Michael Elam, MD, Orange County Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>A Lifestyle Lift is a form of facelift that tightens the SMAS layer and removes the excess skin of the face and neck. Some are combined with liposuction of the fatty tissues of the neck and even suturing the muscles of the neck to give the nice clean neckline that we all desire.</p>
<p>The aging process doesn&#8217;t stop even when you have a Lifestyle Lift or any other named or &#8220;traditional&#8221; face lift. When the tissues relax, they can be re-tightened with a face lift no matter the name.</p>
<p>Liftstyle Lift was often criticized for not lasting as long as a traditional facelift, but the naysayers never accounted for the variables that determine the length of time that any facelift lasts. The determining factors are not only &#8220;father time&#8221;, but genetics, general health, diet, exercise, weight cycles, hormones, smoking, alcohol, sun exposure, thyroid conditions, diabetes, and not the least of all is stress.<br />

Patients have control of a few of the variables. &#8220;Father Time&#8221; gets us all, and we can&#8217;t trade in our parents. That means we are partners in the process (Physicians and Patients).</p>
<p>In some respects, a facelift lasts forever. If you had an identical twin that had the exact same tissue characteristics and factors that you have, and you have the procedure done, you would look 10-15 yrs.</p>
<p>younger than your twin, no matter how old you are. The clock doesn&#8217;t stop when you have a facelift, it only gets turned back. I had the opportunity of doing over 7000 Lifestyle Lifts, and I can truthfully say I have thousands of very happy patients, many of whom have returned for secondary lifts and other procedures. (John A. Standefer Jr., MD, FACS, Dallas Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>The lifestyle lift company is essentially out of business at this time, but that procedure was nothing more than a facelift, so I would not have any problems with doing a second facelift on a patient if it is indicated.<br />

(Reza Momeni, MD FACS, Summit Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Provided that the previous lift did not thin or damage the &#8220;muscle&#8221; (SMAS) layer another (revision) facelift can be performed. I would recommend a deep plane facelift this time which will provide an overall nice, long lasting aesthetic effect.</p>
<p>Also, a revision facelift could potentially remove any scarring that is visible from the previous &#8220;LifeStyle Lift&#8221; procedure. (Timothy R. Miller, MD, Orange County Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Facelift after lifestyle lift, quick lift, etc.</h3>
<p>I have revised literally dozens of patients after the lifestyle lift procedure. Essentially all of the corporate lifts are usually a short flap limited skin elevation lift. These are very light handed and generally involve little if any true dissection of the SMAS tissues.</p>
<p>In general, the skin is very easy to manipulate and in many ways behaves as though no prior surgery has been performed with excellent outcomes. Talk to an experienced surgeon, but I am certain you&#8217;ll do great. (Todd Christopher Hobgood, MD, Phoenix Facial Plastic Surgeon)<br />

Most Lifestyle Lifts around the country were performed as either &#8220;minilifts&#8221; or full lower facelifts where the muscles and skin were tightened.</p>
<p>Lifestyle Lift was more of a branding/marketing strategy than it was a revolutionary procedure. (Paul Lanfranchi, DO, FAOCO, Las Vegas Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>There is a broad range as to what is involved in a lifestyle lift. For some patients, only skin was removed, for others the SMAS layer was tightened. In either case, if you notice new sagging, a revision facelift may be an excellent option.</p>
<p>I would encourage you to see a board certified plastic surgeon in your area to discuss potential options. (Melissa Doft, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)<br />

The challenge that will need to be made by your provider is to what degree the surgery was performed correctly.</p>
<p>Stated differently, your specialist will need to determine how much corrective surgery you will need from your previous surgery in addition to the changes that have occurred since you had your initial facelift. The most important factors responsible for your future success are directly related to your surgeon&rsquo;s training, board certification, surgical specialization, and observed outcomes. (James M. Ridgway, MD, FACS, Bellevue Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h4>Revision Facelift</h4>
<p>It is definitely possibly to have a full facelift following a &#8216;lifestyle lift&#8217; procedure. The &#8216;lifestyle lift&#8217; procedure primarily affects the jowls, while a full facelift can address the midface and neck to a much greater degree for a balanced rejuvenation.<br />

(Jill Hessler, MD, Palo Alto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p><em>Secondary facelifts</em> are common and done well by the vast majority of surgeons. Find an experienced surgeon who can help you determine what will be best for you and for achieving your goals. (Curtis Wong, MD, Redding Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>You can have a facelift after a &#8221; lifestyle lift procedure &#8220;. Please seek out a consultation with a Plastic Surgeon Certified by the Amercian Board of Plastic Surgery and someone which does facelift procedures on a regular basis. (Michael H. Wojtanowski, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p><strong>Can a facelift be performed after having a &#8220;life style lift&#8221; procedure?</strong></p>
<p>It is fairly common to have a complete lower face and neck lift after any previous facelift including a Lifestyle Lift. Choose a surgeon who is very experienced in revision facelift surgeries. This should be a very satisfying procedure for you. (Warren J. Katz, MD, Dallas Facial Plastic Surgeon)<br />

Usually the second procedure is not as involved as the original procedure but that depends on how much was performed the first time.</p>
<p>A well trained and experienced facelift surgeon will be able to perform a second facelift regardless of what type of facelift was performed. If you liked your procedure under local anesthesia, with the proper surgeon this can be done again.</p>
<p>Make sure to choose such an epxerienced board certified surgeon. (Raymond E. Lee, MD, Orange County Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>If your &#8220;Lifestyle lift&#8221; included a mini- facelift under local anesthesia, then there should be no plausible reason why a comprehensive facelift cannot be performed 7 years later if you are a good candidate now for a facelift.<br />

The incisional scars are longer but can be well hidden. When combined with a volumizing procedure such as fat transfers to the face, the results can look much more natural, more refined and longer lasting. (Bao L. Phan, MD, Honolulu Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>A second facelift can be done after any type of previous facial procedure. A true, full facelift is the most long lasting, natural looking facial rejuvenation procedure regardless of what has been done before. That may or may not include the eyes and brow, but a classical &#8220;facelift&#8221; denotes the mid face (cheek ares), jowls, and neck.</p>
<p>All done together, this results in the most pleasing results. Probably more than any other cosmetic surgical procedure, the ultimate results of a facelift depend a great deal upon the skill and the experience of the surgeon.<br />

<p>Some skilled surgeons were able to produce a worthwhile result, but most did not. That company has since gone bankrupt, the major cause apparently being deceptive trade practices. (R. Scott Yarish, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p><b>Comprehensive face/ neck lift after a lifestyle lift</b></p>
<p>It is possible to undergo a properly performed comprehensive lower face and neck lift after any type of lift in the past including a lifestyle lift. A facelift procedure needs to give patients a natural result, so choose your surgeon very wisely based on experience. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)<br />

In most cases, this involves a minilift type procedure performed under local anesthesia with oral sedation. This type of facelift procedure can be revised with a more comprehensive procedure now that you&#8217;re 7 years out from surgery.</p>
<p>Consult with an experienced facelift surgeon for more specific advice. (Stephen Weber, MD, FACS, Denver Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>There is no recognized operation called a &#8220;Lifestyle Lift.&#8221; This was a marketing term used by this business entity that has now gone bankrupt. But in general this &#8220;lift&#8221; was a minimal facelift which might or might not include the neck.</p>
<p>The quality of surgery depended on the surgeon who was employed by the company. Many of the surgeons were quite capable and patients received nice results (though the procedures were usually minimal since in most states the company couldn&#8217;t use sedation and/or general anesthesia on their patients.)<br />

(William McClure, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>A second face lift can be done regardless of the specific technique used in the primary procedure. A full complete lift will last longer than than the typical Life Style Procedure. (Richard W. Fleming, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Regardless of what type of facelift you had in the past, is irrelevant to you having a secondary facelift now. Make sure you go to a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon that specializes in Facelift Revisions.</p>
<p>I have done so many revisions in my career and even wrote a book about Facelift Letdowns. Check out my link to my website below that shows a facelift revision. Hers was a conventional facelift. (Sam T. Hamra, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Revision facelifts are quite common after having a &#8220;life style lift&#8221;. Most facelifts should not require revision for 10 &#8211; 15 years, but in the case of the lifestyle lift, you may not have had a procedure that provided those lasting results.</p>
<p>Secondary procedures are quite safe if performed by a board certified facial plastic surgeon or board certified general plastic surgeon. (David Hayes, MD, Missoula Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>A secondary face lift is the same whether the first one was a traditional face lift or a lifestyle lift, the surgeon likes to know what was done but it is safe to proceed. (Julio Garcia, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)<br />

<p>I have revised several &#8220;Life Style Lifts&#8221; with good results. Without seeing you it is impossible to give specific advice, but keep an open mind to non facelift procedures which may give better results and be less drastic than a second lift procedure such as volume enhancing procedures and ThermiTight. (Curtis Perry, MD, Downey Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>You absolutely may have a facelift surgery after a life style lift, as long as you have enough laxity to your skin to necessitate a surgery. Make sure you see a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon who performs a lot of facelift surgeries. (Milind K. Ambe, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p><b>Facelift needed after &#8220;lifestyle lift.&#8221;</b></p>

<p>Yes, you can have a facelift after a Lifestyle. The important planes for a really good lift will still be intact. A good board-certified Facial Plastic surgeon only does faces and will have dealt with LSL and other facelift revisions numerous times. (David Alessi, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p><b>Secondary Facelift following a &#8220;Life Style Lift&#8221;</b></p>
<p>The &#8220;Life Style Lift&#8221; (LSL) performed years ago was a modified facelift using shorter scars and performed under local anesthetic. With pressure from patients, the LSL morphed into any variation of face and neck lift with additional procedures such as eyelid lift, brow lift and rhinoplasty as requested.<br />
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3443" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 160px"><meta itemprop="width" content="150"><meta itemprop="height" content="200"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Visible-Aging-Off-Your-Face-150x200.jpg" alt="Visible Aging Off Your Face" width="150" height="200" class="size-medium wp-image-3443" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Visible Aging Off Your Face</p></div>Local anesthesia was changed to sedation and general anesthesia as was required for the safety of the patient. Regulatory oversight noted the mis-information and LSL changed to a marketing business. As we all unfortunately experience, aging continues and a secondary facelift is not an unusual request whether it was a &#8220;LSL&#8221; or any other variation of face and neck lift.</p>
<p>Please consult with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon or ENT Facial Surgeon who has experience in the evaluation for revisions of / or performance of secondary facelifts. (Dean P. Kane, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Face lifts are commonly performed after &#8220;lifestyle lifts&#8221;. Your previous &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; lift will not compromise any future lifts assuming your previous lift has had an adequate period of time to mature. Do your homework before proceeding again and be sure to review photos, experience of your doctor and speak with previous patients. (Bruce Landon, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)<br />

(Juan Carlos Fuentes, MD, Mexico Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>You can definitely have a true and full facelift and the results will not be affected by your previous lifestyle lift. But this time do your research, find a skillful, experienced and artistic plastic surgeon and don&#8217;t fall for a sales job on mini surgery with mini results. (Ronald V. DeMars, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>A facelift can improve your facial contour and reshape your neck and jawline after a previous lifestyle lift or other facelift procedure. It is often easier to recover from and has consistent and predictable results. (Afshin Parhiscar, MD, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>A &#8220;revision facelift&#8221; can definitely be performed after any facelift, especially a lifestyle lift. depending on the amount of redundant skin, the incisions from the previous surgery can also be excised. (Samir Undavia, MD, Princeton Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p><b>Conversion of a Lifestyle Lift to a Facelift</b></p>
<p>Because of the variations of the Lifestyle Lift (LL), it is not uncommon to see men and women who are/were unhappy with their LL. Converting it to a facelift with tightening of the underlying muscles of the face (SMAS) is very feasible, safe and yields a powerful results.</p>
<p>In the last several years, I have had the opportunity to do multiple revisions on said patients from a LL to a facelift and the results have been phenomenal. There are no added scars and the same incisions from your LL are used.<br />

(Michael K. Obeng, MD, FACS &#8211; Account Suspended, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Facelifts after &#8220;Lifestyle Lifts&#8221; are fairly common. Most believed that the results of the traditional Lifestyle Lift would last for about 5 years. As a result, many are looking for revision or more traditional facelift procedures. (Joseph Franklin, MD, Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>The limited facelift under local anesthesia, which was the hallmark of the Lifestyle Lift, can readily be revised in most instances. (Sheldon S. Kabaker, MD FACS, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h4>Facelift after Lifestyle lift should be OK by qualified plastic surgeon</h4>
<p>Before the Lifestyle Lift company went out of business, we would often see patients who had that procedure done and were dissatisfied for a variety of reasons. For that reason there are quite a few plastic surgeons around with experience operating on patients who had previously had a Lifestyle Lift but needed a correction.</p>
<p>However, any experienced plastic surgeon should be able to do a secondary facelift after a previous one of any type. (Richard Baxter, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>The Lifestyle lift was a mini lift with a minimal approach. Little was generally accomplished and incisions were at times not well placed. Having a real and very well done facelift is a great idea and certainly the old lift will not hinder this.</p>
<p>Some of the incision placement of the old lift may cause some difficulty in getting the best placement of new incisions but a master surgeon can deal with this. Choose a plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery and a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons. (George Commons, MD, Palo Alto Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>A facelift can be done after one has had a &#8220;Lifestyle lift.&#8221; The Lifestyle lift is a limited procedure that typically won&#8217;t involve much dissection during surgery. A formal lower facelift can be done if you&#8217;ve had one.</p>
<p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3440" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 123px"><meta itemprop="width" content="113"><meta itemprop="height" content="200"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Removing-Excess-Fat-In-The-Skin-113x200.jpg" alt="Removing Excess Fat In The Skin" width="113" height="200" class="size-medium wp-image-3440" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Removing Excess Fat In The Skin</p></div>I would recommend waiting at least 6-12 months before doing this since there will be some scarring right after any surgery. Waiting this long will allow the scars to mature, allowing a revision surgery to go smoother.</p>
<p>A good facelift should achieve desired results that last about 10 years. Make sure you consult a board certified surgeon with experience in doing facelifts. (Kenneth Yu, MD, San Antonio Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>A full facelift can be performed over a lesser operation in the future.</h3>
<p>The lifestyle lift is a minimized facelift with generally modest results. After seven years a well executed full facelift should give you an excellent result. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Facelift surgery is commonly performed on patients who have had previous Lifestyle Lifts. This includes patients who were unhappy with their Lifestyle Lift results and patients who were happy, but the results were not long lasting.</p>
<p>Usually a facelift after a limited procedure like the lifestyle lift is easier than a revision facelift, which is also a common procedure (10-15 years after the first one). See a facelift specialist in your area (facial plastic surgeon or general plastic surgeon who specializes in the face) who can guide you through the process. (Sirius K. Yoo, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p><b>Secondary Facelift </b></p>
<p>You can absolutely have a Facelift after you have had a lifestyle lift in the past. This is a very common consultation in our office, as the lifestyle lift (Mini Facelift) is frequently a short term procedure.</p>
<p>I would recommend that you have a consultation with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon to make a specific plan to address your concerns and goals. (Frederick G. Weniger, MD, FACS, MBA, Hilton Head Island Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p><b>Revision lifts</b></p>

Frequently mini-lifts do need to be revised down the road because the aging process continues and the results tend not to hold up with time.</p>
<p>In general the kinds of results to be expected from facial surgery are proportional to the amount of down time required afterwards- less down time is required from less invasive procedures, but you won&#8217;t get as good results.</p>
<p>Depending on how much work was done previously (and usually it&#8217;s not a lot) you should be able to expect good results. The recovery, of course, will be a bit more involved, but a traditional face lift is excellent for moderate to severe aging changes. (Robert S. Schmidt, MD, College Station Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>The aging process will continue regardless of the type of lift performed. Having a lifestyle lift does not preclude one from having a second lift. I recommend that you consult with an experienced facelift surgeon for an in-person examination to determine if you are a good candidate. (Mark Been, MD, Barrington Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p><b> Secondary facelift after lifestyle lift </b></p>
<p>It should be very possible to do a nice secondary facelift after a lifestyle lift. Especially if you do not have significant scar tissue or absence of normal tissue. If you have laxity and excess tissue this should be something that a well skilled plastic surgeon can help you with. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p>
