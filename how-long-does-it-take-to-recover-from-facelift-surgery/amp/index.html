<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The length of your recovery is directly related to the extensiveness of the procedure performed.</p><p>For a traditional facelift, which involves manipulation of the fatty/muscle layer below the skin, as well as generous lifting and tightening of the skin, most patients are able to go in public 2 weeks after surgery, but camouflage makeup is almost always required.</p><p>After three weeks, the vast majority of patients have experienced resolution of enough bruising and swelling to feel comfortable in public. (Sam Jejurikar, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Recovery from a facelift is different for each patient.</h5><p>Some folk will look good in 2-3 days others may take 2-3 months, both of these are very unusual. I tell my patients plan on about 2-3 weeks. Usually by 3 weeks you will look better than you did before surgery.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2223" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-5729eadb6841f812a47a108d82e9cd34">

</div><p>It is important that you limit your activity for at least 2 weeks to keep your blood pressure and pulse down to limit the risk of post operative bleeding, hematoma.</p><p>After that you should be careful not to hit or bang your face for at least 6-8 weeks to allow for healing.</p><p>The end result will not be completely settled for about 6 months. (Carl W. “Rick” Lentz III, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Facelift recovery takes 2 weeks after surgery</em></p><p>What is your tolerance for being seen with some degree of bruising? If you have anxiety about being seen in the early postoperative phase, my answer is 2 weeks.</p><p>However, I have patients who work from home, and some who are less concerned about being seen in public. Generally, the latter group can be out and about in 4-5 days (best case scenario). This being said, some patients have a less smooth recovery due to anesthesia or other factors, and take longer.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2224" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-83e6c35ef7b5f8984a37bb8ce108c0bb">

</div><p>During this period, you can carefully arrange your hair to conceal incisions and can usually apply makeup between 7-10 days after surgery. If you live in a colder climate, a turtle neck can conceal most of the bruising.</p><p>In addition, Arnica Montana pills and/or cream can help decerase visible signs of brusing. (Stephen Prendiville, MD, Fort Myers Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Facelifts are variable</i></p><p>There is not a standard facelift since there are different techniques and aspects to this generic procedure. Ingeneral, most bruising should be minimal enough to cover with make up 7-10 days post-op. Swelling is more variable.</p><p>The more that is done higher up ( forehead, eyes, cheeks) the longer the swelling should last compared to lower face and neck. Most of the time, I tell patients they can go out in public within 7-10 days since all stitches shold be out by then and they can wear camouflage make-up. (Robin T.W. Yuan, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2225" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><h5>Facelift Recovery</h5><p>Recovery from surgery has many stages. The surgery does not hurt (90% of my patients don’t even take a Tylenol) and the bruising and swelling resolves quickly. That means you look good and feel good, but you are not healed.</p><p>It takes about 28-36 day for tissues to heal. Most patients can be back to work within 2 weeks, but will need to limit their activities. Please note that everyone heals differently and your recovery depends on you.</p><p>Seek a boarded facial plastic surgeon. Look at his photos and ask to speak to previous patients. (James Shire, MD, Chattanooga Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most of the healing from a facelift occurs in the first 4 months. You should be very presentable in 2 weeks. If we consider a time lapsed result for facelift surgery, true results are achieved at 4 months.</p><p>There are many options with less down time such as facial fat grafting, dermal fillers, fractionated CO2 laser resurfacing or a combination of these. (Jose E. Barrera, MD, FACS, San Antonio Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2226" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p><em>Facelift recovery is around 2 weeks</em></p><p>Most patients are comfortable in social settings (including work) by 2 weeks after surgery. Short scar facelifts (sometimes called mini-lifts or anterior facelifts) generally have smaller scars and less bruising and swelling. At 2 weeks, most patients look great with a bit of makeup – perhaps a bit swollen, but quite presentable.</p><p>In fact, at 2 weeks, the question may be, “Did you lose weight? Change your hair? You look rested.”</p><p>One caution: I strongly advise all patients to allow 6 weeks between a facelift and a major social engagement: a wedding, Bar Mitzvah or the event of the season.</p><p>You should not feel any pressure prior to those occasions! (James N. Romanelli, MD, FACS, Long Island Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The recovery from a facelift varies from patient to patient. Patients that can hide the incisions in front of their ear with their hair can typically be out in public in about 5-7 days. There will still be some swelling and patients can experience bruising mostly in the neck area.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2227" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Patients are typically back at work in about two weeks with makeup covering any bruising if any remains. (Christopher T. Maloney Jr., MD, Tucson Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are a multitude of ways to do a facelift, some more aggressive than others and the healing time will vary. It also varies with how much bruising there is. Some patients, typically men and redheads, may bruise more and take longer to be presentable.</p><p>One type of lift I do often looks good in one week with the hair down over the incisions, other more complex procedures may be 2-3 weeks. Pain is rarely much of an issue. (Ronald V. DeMars, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I usually tell my patients that if they are going to be in a “high profile” situation – such as a wedding – to allow themselves a full six weeks for healing prior to the event. Otherwise, my patients seem to feel comfortable with their appearance at about two weeks. (George John Alexander, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2228" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>My short answer to this frequently asked question is that a patient looks fair after 2 weeks, good after 6 months, and continues to recover over 6-12 months. It depends on the patient, health, blood pressure, and degree of correction necessary.</p><p>I have certainly had my share of patients who returned to work 1-3 days after having their surgery!</p><p>Frequently, healthy ladies who wear their hair over their ears, in particular can return to work within days. (Lawrence Kass, MD, Saint Petersburg Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>The final sutures are removed at post-operative day #7. Any post-operative bruising is usually gone by 10-12 days, with any residual bruising after that time settling into the lower neck due to the effects of gravity.</p><p>The incisions are well-hidden, above the hairline or by the natural contours of the ear, so that once the stitches are removed, they are difficult to see unless someone is looking in precisely the correct location.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2229" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-583e2d5637c177739fe6a08f60c19730">

</div><p>Combining all of these factors, and giving a little extra time as a cushion, I would suggest spending anywhere from 2-3 weeks recovery from facelift surgery. Since younger patients tend to heal more quickly, your age at the time of surgery should be factored into this decision. (Michael R. Macdonald, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Recovery from a facelift can vary tremendously , but in general you can look socially acceptable after seven to ten days. You will not feel totally normal for six weeks. Back to work ( depending on what you do, i.e. no heavy lifting) is about two weeks. It’s easier for a woman because they can wear make-up. (Talmage J. Raine, MD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Every patient heals differently. My patients typically take 10-14 days off for recovery from a facelift.</p><p>There may be a little swelling at this point but not enough so that most patients woul be uncomfortable in public. (Michael Sullivan, MD, Columbus Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2230" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-2984ce0bd9766530ee6db3180fe2b84d">

</div><p>There are several factors that come into play when answering this question. Mostly it depends on what kind of Facelift you are getting done.</p><p>If you are just getting a lower Facelift usually the bruising will last only about a week or two and the incisions can be hidden by the hairline.</p><p>If you are doing the eyes and brow as well it can take a few weeks to look better. It is always nice to consult with a makeup specialist or esthetician before your surgery to help with covering up the bruises so you can get back out there! (Miguel Delgado, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Some people bruise and swell more than others. The short end of the spectrum is probably one week. If a patient swells and bruises, recovery could extend beyond two weeks.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2231" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b527d53b3c9f8347f60fc0f1d1176e70">

</div><p>It is important for any patient to properly prepare themselves for surgery.</p><ul>
<li>Avoid blood thinners such as aspirin and ibuprofen</li>
<li>Stop most herbal products and vitamin E before surgery</li>
<li>Consider a good skin exfoliation program 4-6 weeks before surgery to stimulate blood flow</li>
<li>Bromelain, the active ingredient in pineapples, Anica, and vitamin K cream may help.</li>
</ul><p>Ice compresses and head elevation for the first 48 hours After 48 hours consider lymphatic drainage and warmth afterwards to help break up swelling and bruising. (Brian Maloney, MD, FACS, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Recovery after a facelift depends on the type of surgery performed. More extensive lifts may cause more bruising or swelling. Expect to return to normal daily activity after 5-7 days. 2 weeks after a facelift, you can start working out again.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2232" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Most patients can get back to their normal social activities at 2-3 weeks. I use homeopathic treatment, herbal remedies such as arnica, and special cooling masks to expedite recovery which my patients love and appreciate. (Etai Funk, MD, Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Recovery allows you to resume social activities 2 weeks</em></p><p>Most patients are able to return to work and social activities two weeks after a facelift. On a rare occasion, a small bruise can persist longer than that, but can be concealed with makeup. For women, hairstyles should cover the ears, and a turtleneck or scarf can be worn to cover up any neck swelling and bruising.</p><p>Men sometimes grow a beard to cover up the incisions around the ears for the first couple of months.

</div><h4>How long is the recovery for a face lift?</h4><p>The short answer is: two weeks. After two weeks, most of the bruising and swelling has resolved, and makeup can cover the scars fairly well. Obviously, the more extensive the operation, the longer the recovery.</p><p>Facelift patients don’t experience significant pain, and most stop taking narcotic pain medication after three to five days. The sutures are removed within a week, and patients may wash their hair and apply makeup after three days.(Maurice M. Khosh, MD, New York Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Going in public after a facelift</b></p><p>For most patients having a facelift and ancillary procedures (i.e. cheeklift, laser resurfacing, subcutaneous browlifts, upper and lower eyelids) the recovery times are 2 weeks for looking OK, not great. That generally means makeup is necessary.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2234" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d11181e0e3019f692419954555988c59">

</div><p>Patients usually feel comfortable at major functions or appearances at speaking engagements or on camera after 4 weeks. For a straightforward facelift only performed by an expert facelift surgeon, the recovery time is typically 10 days for public appearances and 3 weeks for more important events.</p><p>Every patient is different,and every surgery is different so these are broad guidelines. We have seen patients on camera after 6 days and others still limping along at 6 weeks. Patients shouldn’t cram too much into their schedules right after surgery.</p><p>It is a time for recovery and relaxation. Patients shouldn’t put themselves under the stress of ‘I-must-be-fabulous-in-2 weeks’! When properly done, the facelift is a lifetime investment that will be with the patient long after their current car and (statistically) their house is gone.(Brent Moelleken, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Although there are variations in facelift techniques, generally swelling which is obvious to the general public and bruising resolve by 10 days to 2 weeks.</p><p>The surgical procedure is easy to recover from as the manipulation is done in a small area and most of the area operated on has decreased sensation making post operative pain minimal.</p><p>Women have the advantage of applying makeup which can enhance your recovery time and camouflage any persistent bruising or visible scars in the early recovery period (Robert W. Kessler, MD, FACS, Corona Del Mar Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Facelift recovery depends on the type of facelift.</i></p><p>In today’s world of plastic surgery there are different degrees of facelifting. It also depends upon how you wear you hair. If you only need a facelift limited to incisions around the ear and the central neck compartment is not entered then you can be presentable in 2-3 days with your hair worn in such a way to cover your suture lines.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2236" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-616770de351ecbe132babf5831dfd60f">

</div><p>With more complete facelifts in which the central neck compartment in entered and combined with a lateral approach, the bruising is more significant. I tell my patients to count on 7-10 days before they would attend a social gathering in which they don’t mind people knowing.</p><p>At this point though you will look better than before surgery. The complete recovery untill all the little minor contour irregularities are resolved and the incisions have faded will be more like 3 months. (Edward Buckingham, MD, Austin Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>What Do You Consider a “Freak”?</h4><p>The biggest problem after any type of surgery is the amount of bruising and swelling that occurs. While certain things can be done to minimize bruising and swelling, there is no way to predict what may happen.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2237" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>While patients can go out into public in 2-3 days after facelift surgery, there will be stitches in place and likely some amount of bruising and swelling. For most patients, 2 week is enough time to recover.</p><p>At this point, make up may be necessary to cover some bruises and in men, it may be needed to cover the incisions in front of the ear. At one month, most, if not all bruising and swelling should be resolved.</p><p>The incisions may still be red and require makeup for coverage for several more weeks, if not months. For my patients who say that they don’t want anyone to know they had anything done, I advise one month with the caveat that makeup on the incision lines may be necessary. (D.J. Verret, MD, Dallas Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Depends on the facelift surgery and the support</b></p><p>Face lift is a generic term and covers a wide variety of possibilities. Patients will be back much more quickly if the office has an on site esthetician who can help the patient conceal the early recovery phase.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2235" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Our less invasive patients are back within days with the help of concealers and even our most invasive are back in 9 days. The secret to quick recovery is a patient esthetician and a listening patient.(Nathan Mayl, MD (retired), Fort Lauderdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>2 weeks social downtime after facelift</i></p><p>I advise my patients that after two weeks, with make-up and fashion, most patients are passable socially. If the eyelids are not part of the facelift, usually the social down time is only a few days.</p><p>Bruising after facelift is usually minimal and most commonly in the neck that can be covered with a collar. The eyes are a focus of attention and even a little bruising and swelling is easily appreciated.(Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Facelift Recovery</strong></p><p>Recovery from a facelift can vary depending on what other facial procedures are being performed at the same time. If you’re only having a facelift, then the normal recovery is 1-2 weeks.</p><p>You will notice some swelling for a couple of months after surgery, but this swelling should not be noticeable to those around you. I remove sutures at 1 week after surgery, after which most patients are able to go out into public with just some light makeup.</p><p>Recovery can vary a little depending on the facelift technique used, but typically falls within the 1-2 weeks time frame.
