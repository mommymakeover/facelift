<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>In general the cost of botox injections to treat wrinkling will be determined by how much you need and can range from $400 to 1500.  Ther are three FDA approved botulinum toxins in the USA: Botox Cosmetic, Xeomin and Dysport.</p><p>Most offices charge more for Botox Cosmetic and slightly less for the equivalent dose of Xeomin or Dysport.  Some offices charge by area, others by unit, but I advise you not to shop around by price.</p><p>Instead pick the most qualified physician for the procedure.  Remember you are not ‘buying’ the Botox, you are paying for the procedure. (Heidi A. Waldorf, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p>Nationally, most providers will charge anywhere between $10-16 per unit of Botox injections, with the national average being around $13 per unit. </p><p>The price of Botox is contingent really on two factors: 1) the price per unit of Botox; and 2) the number of units required to achieve the look you want.<br>

</div>Different areas of the face require varying amounts of units be used. For example, a simple forehead injection may require between 15-20 units of Botox, so your procedure can add up very quickly. With all of that being said, there are two clinics in the greater Hattiesburg, Mississippi area that offer Botox: Hattiesburg Clinic and Pine Belt Dermatology & Skin Cancer Center.
<p>Both offer Botox injections at $12 a unit. So the short answer to “what does Botox cost in Hattiesburg” would be $12 a unit. Something to keep an eye out for is when either clinic hosts a special for Botox.</p><p>Both providers do have reocurring specials. HC sells Botox at $10 a unit every 6 weeks, whereas Pine Belt Dermatology & Skin Cancer Center hosts a special every 8 weeks with the price of a unit of Botox being $9.<br>

</div>One last note on the price of Botox is that most providers, no matter where you go, will charge you a Botox/cosmetic consultation fee. 
<p>It is important to ask the provider you visit whether or not that consultation fee will be attributed towards your Botox services (if you end up purchasing them post-consultation).</p><p>It is usually not much, but will still lower the amount you spend on the injectable. Hope this answer helps!. (David Roy, DO, Hattiesburg Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Allergan has increased the cost of Botox each year. In St Louis, you can expect to pay from $11 to $15 per unit with some variation depending on the type of provider.</p><p>In addition to Botox, it is quite common to find providers of Dysport in the St Louis area. The cost for Dysport generally ranges from $3.50 to $4.25 per unit. As a general rule, it takes three times as many units of Dysport as Botox so the overall price is very similar, if not even a little less expensive. (Richard E. Moore, MD, Saint Louis Physician)<br>

</div><h3>Cost of Botox injections – Rockford, IL.</h3><p>At Transformations Plastic Surgery, we have a staff of highly trained Registered Nurses and Nurse Practitioners who perform the injectable treatments.  </p><p>We charge $15 per unit for Botox and the amount of units needed is variant upon each patient.</p><p> Botox is an excellent and affordable way to improve the appearance of aging. (Landon Pryor, MD, FACS, Rockford Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In Portland, the cost of Botox varies from $10 to $16 dollars. It does depend on the experience of the injector (doctor versus aesthetician for example and years of experience). Botox treatment can be customized to use more or less units depending on the results you want to achieve.</p><p>For example, if you have a very deep line in the forehead between the brows you might need 30 units in that area versus if you are wanting to prevent the line from forming you might only need 10 units.<br>

</div>Having said that, a  typical treatment is 25 units for the frown lines between the brows (called the glabella) and the lines around the eyes. There are usually some “specials” when you can get botox injections at a discounted price.
<p>In my office, we tend to have a patient appreciation event and will sell botox and fillers injections at a special price to thank patients for coming to our practice. (Myriam Loyo, MD, Portland Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox injections is usually priced by ‘unit’ or by ‘area’. Botox costs on average between $9-$13 per unit. The cost usually reflects the experience and qualifications of the injector. To treat your ’11’s’ or ‘crows feet’ requires around 20-30 units.

</div>Botox in the upper face is a reliable was to weaken over used facial expression muscles to provide a more youthful and relaxed (ie less stressed and tired) appearance. 
<p>While Botox injections costs can vary (average CDN$10/unit) – an essential element is the expertise/experience of the injector.</p><p>For individual patients, the size and strength of muscles to be treated must be considered to provide the desired effect. In the frown line area for example, the frown muscles can be much larger and stronger in men than women – requiring larger doses (25-35 units).</p><p>The size of foreheads also vary between individuals – so this needs to be considered along with strength of underlying muscles (typically 10-20 units). Over-treatment of this area can lead brow droop or heaviness in those who have lower brows to begin with.<br>

</div>Often, I recommend a Botox lid elevation treatment to avoid this issue (20 units). 
<p>Crows feet lines can improve with standard treatments of 20 units and we often add 10 units below the lower lid to provide more curvature to the lid lower margin. (Jerry Tan, MD, Windsor Dermatologist)</p><p>Usually it is about $10 a unit. It depends on areas you want treated. So it can range between 200-1000 dollars or so. (Samer Muala, MD, Phoenix Family Physician)</p><p>The cost of Botox injections will vary based upon the part of the country you are in. In our practice the regular price is $12 per unit. However, we often have BOTOX events at which BOTOX is $9.</p><p>50 per unit. Your total cost would be determined by the number of areas treated and the total number of units needed for proper correction. The average patient uses 20-30 units but some get as high as 60- units. (Janet Turkle, MD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>As with any procedure cost can vary based on location and the physician’s fee as well as evolve based on product cost. Most offices charges by the unit with Botox. The average unit price in our region may range anywhere from $10 to $16 per unit.
<p>The number of units utilized during treatment depends on individual anatomy and the areas being treated. The average number of units used for a treatment can range from 20 to 70 units depending on goals and candidacy.</p><p>Be cautious of discounts or deals that sound too good to be true. Often they are! Experience is also very important. We for instance have national trainers on staff for Allergan the company that makes Botox who have been practicing for 20 years.</p><p>We are also in the top 2% for volume of injectables in the country through Allergan.

</div>The price of Botox injections will vary depending on the areas being treated and the amount needed. In the glabella or crow’s feet , for example, up to 25 units may be used per area. With the price per unit varying from $11-15/ unit, this results in a cost range of $275-$375 for each area. (Burke Robinson, MD, FACS, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<p>The most accurate way to determine the cost of Botox is to determine how many units of Botox you’ll need. This varies on the area you wish to quiet (forehead, crow’s feet, glabella, etc). I suggest meeting with a highly-trained physician for a consultation.</p><p>They will be able to tell you approximately how many units of Botox are needed to quiet the desired treatment area. </p><p>Botox typically costs between $12-$17 per unit in the Kansas City area. When comparing the Botox unit costs between practices, remember that you get what you pay for.<br>

<p><b>Botox prices in London, UK</b></p><p>In the UK, for some reason, Botox type treatments are priced per area. This does seem unfair to me as many patients require different doses and it seems fairer to charge according to dose required.</p><p>However, it is what it is in the UK and many patients prefer this form of pricing as it allows them to “compare” between practitioners although it must be said that price is not a reliable indicator of quality of injector skills.</p><p>In my practice, all new patients have a detailed consultation using my patient-consultation format. During the consultation I will take plenty of time to understand your motivations for attending today and the results you are hoping to achieve.<br>

</div>You will also receive a joint full facial assessment – i.e. I will guide you on how to assess your face as well. Then we work out treatment plans together and you will be given these to take home to read over again in your own time.
<p>If Botox – type treatments are suitable for you, I generally advise that you will require treatments about every 4 months for the next 2-3 years and then after that the frequency of treatments may reduce to every 5-6 months, but this doesn’t happen to everybody.</p><p>I also advise that I don’t create FROZEN faces – the aim is to create a healthy, relaxed and refreshed looking face rather than that of a mannequin. </p><p>All my new patients are given a follow-up appointment 4 weeks after their initial treatment to check the outcome.</p><p></p>

<h5>Pricing for Botox</h5><p>Pricing does vary by location and by office, but keep in mind the saying “you get what you pay for” definitely rings true here. Our strong recommendation is to do your research when deciding on a clinic who boasts lowest pricing.</p><p>They in essence, have to cut costs from somewhere and usually that’s not in the favor of the customer. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><p>Botox injection cost depends on 3 things. Where, who and when. In our practice we use only physician injectors. It is a personal choice. We charge 15$ per unit. If the results are going to be considered mine I prefer to be the injector.<br>

<b>Where: Varies by location.</b> Similar to rent and housing. Would be an interesting study. That being said, I worked in Orange County CA and we charged must less. That is because every corner had someone injecting botox haha.
<p><b>When: There are always specials with botox.</b> If you are getting other procedures it is a very negotiable part of treatment. It is used to make patients happy and I often include some units with specific teatments.</p><p>All of my facelift patients get 20 units that I use to maximize results with no charge. (Benjamin Caughlin, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Seattle Area Botox and Other Botulinum Toxins</i></p><p>The cost of Botox injections and other Botulinum Toxins in the Seattle area can vary anywhere between $10-$16 depending on specials and average cost. </p><p>Many charge by unit and on average patients receive anywhere from 20-60 units every 3-4 months. Generally 30-40 units per treatment is a very common range to receive treatment anywhere from the forehead area, glabella and crows feet. If it’s your first time receiving this sort of treatment, look for offices who offer a complimentary consultation so that you can get an idea of how many units will be required to achieve your desired results and you can be prepared for the cost.</p><p>Depending on the Botulinum Toxins offered by the Doctor or practice you are seeing, there may be introductory pricing and/or a rewards program to offer additional discounts.
