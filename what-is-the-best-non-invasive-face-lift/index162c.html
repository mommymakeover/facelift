<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><strong>The best alternative to a face lift depends on the patient.</strong></p><p>For some patients there is no best alternative. To get what they want they need a face lift.</p><p>For others there are a range of non invasive treatments that can rejuvenate the face very effectively and very safely. Often the face lift is combined with these non invasive treatments. As we age we accumulate a set of visual clues to how old we are.</p><p>These clues have multiple causes and have a very gradual onset. Some of these visual clues are the result of environmental injury to the skin. This is mostly the consequence of sun exposure, but cigarette smoking and air pollution hurt too.</p><p>Environmental (UV light) injury causes the skin to become irregularly discolored with red and brown dyschromias.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1354" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>These color changes can add up to 20 years to the aged appearance of the face. Another effect of sun injury is that the skin becomes loose and wrinkle prone due to disorganization of elastic fibers and loss of collagen.</p><p>This is called solar elastosis. Facial muscles that continually compress this damaged skin cause permanent wrinkles to form. As we age we loose volume in the face; there is atrophy of bone fat and muscle.</p><p>This, combined with gravity and loose wrinkle prone skin, creates deep folds and furrows in the skin.</p><p>There is probably no single treatment that attacks all of these accumulated visual clues of age so a combination is needed.</p><p>Tailoring the combination to the needs and desires of the patient is the job of the treating physician. Some of the combinations are the use of a neuromodulator like Botox to weaken or relax the wrinkle producing muscles, along with a volume replacing filler like hyaluronic acid to re-inflate the atrophied tissues.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1355" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>The skin itself can be improved as well. IPL or Intense Pulsed Light will smooth out the irregular discolorations and brighten the skin to restore the youthful glow. Laser resurfacing with a fractionated CO2 laser like Active FX restores texture and tightens the skin by stimulating collagen production.</p><p>It is by the judicious of multiple non invasive treatments that we can frequently for stall or avoid a face lift.</p><p>Once again, the treatment must be tailored to the individual patient’s circumstances. (Robert Swanson, MD – RETIRED, Bay Area General Surgeon)</p><p>While nothing can replace facelift is someone who really needs it, there are finally viable alternatives for those that are not yet ready for the surgery. The best results are achieved by combining the incredible Titan laser with other lasers and adding Botox and fillers as needed.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1356" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>These Titan combination procedures are commonly called “3D” and “5D”. In our Rejuvenation Center, we first do a Visia skin analysis and do a pre-rejuvenation skin treatment, which includes a deep cleaning facial and microdermabrasion.</p><p>A plan is designed for each patient which includes home care with products selected for each individual.</p><p>We have come a long way in the field of non-invasive rejuvenation and this is only good news for patients. (Edmond A. Zingaro, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Facelift Alternatives</strong></p><p>These days a lot of patients are opting for non-invasive facial rejuvenation instead of the traditional form of nip/tuck. I like to offer patients who are looking for a gentle yet effective time reversal, my Hydra-FaceLift.</p><p>As we well know, aging can lead to volume and collagen loss in the face. By using synthetic collagen/fillers one can actually add volume to areas of the face that have started to lose that fullness.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1357" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-b4ce11390ef852fc1df830de3566001b">

</div><p>I like to fill nasolabial lines, marionette lines, lips, hollow appearing eyes, cheeks… any area, with long lasting temporary fillers. I prefer not to use permanent fillers to enhance soft tissue volume because of the unpredictability of aging.</p><p>If a permanent filler is put in and the face changes dramatically, the patient is not doing themselves any favors.</p><p>The face can look different and the filler can stand out from surrounding tissues, warranting invasive excision, the one thing that most patients are trying to avoid.</p><p>In this day and age where patients are wanting to enhance their appearance but do not fit the criteria for a invasive lift, we have great resources to offer them.</p><p>So what I prefer to use in my patients who want a longer lasting temporary filler, is Radiesse.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1358" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It is a great longer lasting alternative to Restylane or Juvederm. Restylane can last up to 6 months and Juvederm I have seen last up to 9 months. Radiesse lasts up to a year, all the while building collagen! Those extra few months have been well worth it for my patients, in lengthening their return to my office for injections.</p><p>Also the effect of Radiesse, of building collagen in the injection areas, is wonderful because the patient doesn’t return down to baseline in a few months when the filler wears off. There is a greater fill to deeper nasolabial folds with Radiesse and I Iike to top off the superficial lines with Juvederm.</p><p>The results are great in combination with Thermage for a longer lasting smoothness and tightness to the skin, and thus rejuvenation. Thermage does not put a Band-aid on the situation, but addresses the cause of skin laxity by building back the lost collagen and tightening the skin over time, giving a soft, lifted appearance to sagging facial skin.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1359" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-1718a8105512214d9486fd4f0a714a4e">

</div><p>We are getting great non-invasive face-lifting just with these modalities, which combines Botox, Juvederm, Radiesse and Thermage (Skin Tightening and Collagen Building). (Sofia Rubbani, MD, Tucson Ophthalmologist)</p><p>Laxity or sagging of the skin caused by aging or weight loss is best corrected with a standard facelift procedure that involves redraping and tightening of the facial tissues and excision of redundant, or extra, skin.</p><p>Lesser invasive procedures like threadlifts, radiofrequency tightening, or procedures to lift the face touted as “no downtime” or “lunchtime facelifts” generally do not produce as long-lasting or satisfying results as the traditional facelift. Neck laxity, jowling, and midface descent are all signs of aging that are best addressed by a facelift, which many plastic surgeons believe to be the gold-standard for facial rejuvenation.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1360" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Beware of procedures that are branded, or advertised on TV infomercials, where it is difficult to discern from the information you are given who will be doing the procedure or the technique used. (Jennifer L. Walden, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In my experience a combination of fillers (such as Voluma and Radiesse) to restore volume loss with Ultherapy to lift and tighten the skin can produce comparable results to some facelifts depending on the deficit one started with (Sabrina Fabi, MD, San Diego Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Non-invasive options work for mild jowls</h4><p>Adding volume to the face (specifically over the cheek bones) can fill out loose skin and give the illusion of a subtle lift. Botox can relax tight muscles in the neck that cause bands to form under the chin.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1361" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Ultrasound and radiofrequency tightening treatments help firm the tissues, but this effect is often minimal and sometimes temporary. If there is a significant amount of loose skin and excess fat, then nothing will replace a facelift. (Dana Goldberg, MD, Jupiter Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Liquid Face Lifts will help smooth out the jowls more than it does the neck</em></p><p>In order to answer your question, I would like to discuss the two main causes for sagging of the jowls and neck. One is the loss of skin elasticity.</p><p>This can be addressed via non invasive skin tightening procedures, such as Thermage, minimally invasive surgery such as Smart Lipo or Precision Laser Lifts.</p><p>The second cause of sagging around the jaw line is deflation or loss of facial volume along the cheeks and the jaw line itself. When the face deflates, there is less support for the skin, and it sags downward and forward contributing to the loss of definition along the jaw line.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1362" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-616770de351ecbe132babf5831dfd60f">

</div><p>This can be reversed by restoring lost facial volume also known as Liquid Face Lifts. When too much volume is put in, and no emphasis on skin tightening, there is an imbalance and unnatural result.</p><p>Just like when the skin is pulled too tight in over done facelifts, so to overfilling can create an unwanted look.</p><p>When done naturally, Liquid Face Lifts can have an uplifting effect. There are many options for volume restoration.</p><p>The key is not so much what is used but where its placed for the best results. (Ran Y. Rubinstein, MD, Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Ulthera is a non-invasive approach to skin laxity of the the jawline and neck</i></p><p>The honest answer is that there is no true substitute for a well-performed facelift or necklift to treat redundancy or laxity of skin along the jawline and neck. In our practice we have tried the full gamut of non-invasive options to address these issues.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1363" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In our experience, the non-invasive treatment that has met with the highest patient approval ratings is Ulthera. This is a device that transmits ultrasound energy to the deeper layers of the skin, and even the SMAS/Platysma layer, and thereby causes some degree of skin contraction, as well as fibroblast proliferation in the skin.</p><p>There can be some toning and firming immediately following the treatment, but the full lifting and tightening effect will build gradually over the course of two to three months or so. Some patients have seen results continue to build for up to six months.</p><p>It takes three to six months until the final results can be appreciated, and at that point the majority of our patients do see some moderate improvement in these areas. It is not a facelift, but it may hold you over for a bit. (Peter Lee, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>For a noninvasive facelift, injectables and Botox can all help to give you a rejuvenated appearance. These can definitely work when performed by an experienced injector. However, it really depends on what your concerns are. (Michael Constantin Gartner, DO, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)
<p><i>Voluma to give you younger look</i></p><p>This may depend on what you’re looking to achieve. If you have hollowness in your face I recommend Voluma to instantly volumize the mid-face area. Voluma can last up to two years giving you a younger appearance. (Bruce E. Katz, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Best Non Invasive Cosmetic Treatments and Effectiveness</strong></p><p></p>

</div>There are many non invasive cosmetic treatments that are highly effective such as facial injections of Sculptra, Botox, Dysport, Voluma, Restylane, and Botox. The injections can volumize the face and correct wrinkles in different areas.
<p>If you combine facial injections with lasers such as Fraxel to help with pigmentation and fine lines, you improve the overall complexion and rejuvate the skin as well. Skin tightening lasers definitely work but realistic expectations are the key.</p><p>Skin tightening with lasers such as BBL or Thermage work very well but need to be repeated every two years for the best results. For the best cosmetic results please consult a board certified dermatologist with a great deal of experience with lasers and facial injections. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p><i>Resurfacing, fillers and BOTOX® are a great combination for noninvasive rejuvenation.</i></p><p>Noninvasive procedures like resurfacing (microdermabrasion, chemical peels or laser resurfacing) combined with dermal fillers and BOTOX® Cosmetic can make a big impact on the minor signs of aging throughout the face. This approach is becoming very popular as a “first line of defense” in the battle against aging for many men and women.</p><p>The trick is to find a surgeon who is happy to work closely with you in developing an individualized treatment plan that addresses your specific concerns. Also, keep in mind that as effective as these are in the short-term, more advanced signs of aging due to muscle laxity are best addressed through surgery. (Glenn M. Davis, MD, FACS, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p>

</div>There is so much out there that it’s a tough question for most people. What works for one may not be the best option for all and can leave someone feeling frustrated and overwhelmed. 
<p>It’s best to find a board certified plastic surgeon or dermatologist that has the education and background to treat specific conditions and offer you the more comprehensive treatment.</p><p>Usual coarse of action is to get a baseline analysis. I use the VISIA 3-D imaging that provides this type of analysis and we can track your improvement. Each person is unique and will present with their own goals that they are interested in improving.</p><p>Find someone that will work with you and you can develop a trusting relationship with. (Alfred Sofer, MD, FACS, Fairfield Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox produces the greatest reward for the lowest risk of any cosmetic treatment. With 30 years experience performing all cosmetic plastic surgery procedures and treatments, I have found that Botox gives the most consistent patient satisfaction with almost no risk of bad results or complications.</p><p>Well administered Botox softens frown lines between the eyes, smooth the forehead, and decreases crow’s feet. It can be used to create the affect of a subtle brow lift without surgery. Fillers such as Radiesse,Restylane, and Juvederm can smooth wrinkles, fill nasolabial folds from the nose to the corner of the mouth, and enhance the cheekbones and jaw line.</p><p>Combining Botox and a variety of fillers, a cosmetic plastic surgeon can perform a non invasive ” Liquid Facelift.” (Richard L. Dolsky, MD (retired), Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
