</div><h3>Facial tightening techniques</h3><p>To be honest, nothing is able to lift the cheeks, jowls and nasolabial folds like a facelift other than a facelift. We all have different devices in our office that can make modest changes but to really get people to the point they are happy it often requires a facelift.</p><p>That being said it is all about the expectations and goals of the patient. If you are only looking for some skin tightening then some of the microcurrent, radiofrequency and ultrasounds devices may be right for you.</p><p>I recommend seeing a surgeon in your area that does a lot of facelifts and making sure to be clear about your goals. The goal for us is happy patients and a key to that is nailing down exactly what you are looking for.<br>

</div>I would wait at least 3 months prior to doing any procedure with fillers in place. You don’t want to be chasing your tail so to speak. (Benjamin Caughlin, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<p>The verdict is still out on this one. It is possible microcurrent helps with overall skin health, however I am concerned it might not be effective beyond that. </p><p>It would seem like electricity would help facial muscles and lead to tightening, but we haven’t really seen that (and studies have not shown this).</p><p> I am concerned microcurrent will not address excessive skin, neck fat, jowling, or sagging facial tissues. Hence, if you are going to consider trying this, go into it with a bit of skepticism (eyes wide open) and realistic expectation.<br>

</div>I would consider it more of a facial and not directly comparable with a facelift. (Myriam Loyo, MD, Portland Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<h3>Proven Ways to Reduce Facial Aging</h3><p>You’re definitely not the first person to look for alternatives to the cost, recovery time, scarring, and discomfort of plastic surgery. And there actually are some non-surgical procedures that can help you look younger without surgery.</p><p>But there are two important facts to consider </p><p>There are scientifically proven ways to help you look younger without surgery, but the microcurrent facial is not one of them. Procedures like non-surgical skin tightening (such as Protégé™ by BTL Aesthetics), fractional laser skin resurfacing with certain specialized lasers (such as DOT Therapy™), Botox®, and facial fillers have all been cleared by the FDA as safe and effective, so as long as they’re performed by a qualified and experienced medical professional like a board-certified plastic surgeon, you have a higher likelihood of getting the results you want.<br>

</div>Microcurrent facials, on the other hand, have no clinical studies to support their claims (to my knowledge). The simple fact is that no non-surgical procedures can produce results that are as dramatic and precise as a facelift or sometimes a mini facelift.
<p>Face lifts tighten the skin while also lifting and repositioning the underlying facial tissue, and this is the only way to get the comprehensive facial rejuvenation that makes patients look ten or fifteen years younger.</p><p>If you do want a significant improvement but with minimal recovery time, you might be a candidate for a mini facelift instead: a less invasive version of the facelift, and one which can sometimes even be performed with just local anesthesia.

</div>With aging, the facial skin actually increases in surface area. The muscles of the neck also begin to lose their elasticity and will increase in length. These two events — muscle loosening, sagging skin can only be permanently treated with a surgical facelift- to remove the excess skin and tighten the muscle.
<p>I am not a proponent of non surgical techniques as a primary method to reverse the aging face. Once the surgical procedure is successfully performed – then certain non surgical techniques can be used to add to the longevity.</p><p>As a primary tool – in my opinion- these devices are useless. (Thomas Trevisani, Sr., MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Microcurrent facelift – Not Like a Facelift View Video</h5><p>A facelift, or facial rejuvenation is a surgical procedure that addresses all aging issues of the face. A microcurrent procedure is nothing like a facelift, but, there can be some benefit to electrical devices during facials, however there is no comparing this to a face lift.<br>

</div>Don’t fall for gimmicks. Find an honest and experienced, well trained plastic surgeon.
<p>Recently, patients have been asking what are ELITE credentials from a plastic surgeon. The following are a few things that can distinguish some surgeons from others</p><p>1) Graduating from a top tier medical School at the top of their class.</p><p>2) Membership in Alpha Omega Alpha. THis is the medical honors society. Alpha Omega Alpha is to medicine what Phi Beta Kappa is to letters </p><p>3) Formal surgical training from prestigious medical universities. The minimum number of years of surgical training for plastic surgeons to be board certified in five years. Some physicians have as many as ten years of formal surgical training. There simply is no substitute for stelar academic and practical surgical training.<br>

</div>4) Membership in ASAPS, the aesthetic plastic surgery society shows a plastic surgeon has an intert in, and experience in aesthetic surgery.
<p>5) ELITE surgeons will have photgraphic evidence of their work. patients should be able to view many photos of the surgery of interest, photgraphed from three different perspectives all with similar lighting, distance from the camera and croppingThe ELITE experience extends beyoind the surgeon to the facility, and the surgical team.</p><p>The Joint Commission is an organization that provides certification to hospital OR’s. The Joint Commission and AAAASF are two of the organizations that can provide certification to surgical suites. Some plastic surgeons elect to have their surgery centers dually certified.</p><p>The anesthesia experience is critical to a safe and comfortable surgical experience. A baord certified anesthesiologist can administer general or MAC anesthesia. My preference is to have a board-certified anesthesiologist at the bedside of my patients for the duration of surgery.<br>

</div>Of course it is essential to view many, many before and after photos as this is evidence of the talent and expertise of a surgeon. (Michael Law, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)
<p>How long the microcurrent facelift lasts – it causes minute muscle contractions and will work for as long as you have the microcurrent turned on.</p><p>It also causes wounds to heal a little faster, but then you won’t have a wound to heal so not much benefit there. Of course your money will be gone forever. (Ronald V. DeMars, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Microcurrent facelift is a misnomer</b></p><p>A microcurrent procedure really doesn’t act like a facelift. The changes will be very subtle, if there are any at all. If you need a facelift, it can be properly done by a qualified surgeon and not leave an operated look. (Richard P.

</div>It is unlikely to get a visible change from the micro current treatments. If you have loose skin then facelift is the way to go. (Tanveer Janjua, MD, Bedminster Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<p> I don’t know that there is very good evidence that a micocurrent facelift makes much of a different in your appearance. When dealing with fillers and surgical facelifts, they can be done in close proximity to one another.</p><p>Often times the filler is seen during the surgery, so if you want to take full advantage of your filler, wait a year before having surgery!(David A. Sieber, MD, Bay Area General Surgeon)</p><h4>Microcurrent facelift? Don’t waste your money!</h4><p>Truth is, you can have a “microcurrent” facelift any time you want… but why would you? It will do nothing to improve your appearance, but it will make you feel sad for spending money on a treatment that does nothing. (Theda C. Kontis, MD, Baltimore Facial Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>There is not clinical study on this topic, but experience. Each physician will have his or her preferences. Allow your treating physician to guide you as he or she knows the scope of treatment and the specifics about you. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)
<h3>Not Enough Evidence Yet</h3><p>At this point, there simply isn’t enough evidence to suggest that microcurrent treatments are comparable to facelift surgery – or, for that matter, that they are effective for what they claim to do. Skepticism is wise with any treatment that promises facelift-caliber results without surgery, since this has always been very difficult to achieve.</p><p>If you do still wish to proceed with a microcurrent treatment, I don’t believe you need to wait after having an injectable. If you’re interested in facial rejuvenation, please be sure to see a board-certified plastic surgeon who offers proven treatments. (James N. Romanelli, MD, FACS, Long Island Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<em>Facelift Without Surgery Isn’t a Facelift</em><p>The popularity of nonsurgical facial rejuvenation treatments is understandable, but it’s always important to understand that the results of these procedures cannot match facial plastic surgery, such as a facelifts, neck lifts, or brow lifts.</p><p>Like other energy-based treatments, a microcurrent facial stimulates the production of new collagen by creating controlled (gentle) injuries to the skin. The healing process produces collagen, which is a fundamental building block of tighter, more youthful skin.</p><p>In other words, the procedure is literally skin-deep. A surgical facelift, on the other hand, actually repositions the tissue and muscle underlying the skin, which is why the results are much more dramatic and last longer. (Marc DuPéré, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>“Microcurrent facelift” is not a good option</h5><p></p>

</div>There is truly no substitute for a surgical facelift. The basis for a “microcurrent facelift” has not been scientifically validated in the peer-reviewed literature. You are better off saving your funds for a more definitive surgical procedure that is likely to have longer-lasting, more robust results. (Lara Devgan, MD, MPH, New York Plastic Surgeon)
<p><b>Unproven technology</b></p><p>The use of microcurrent technologies to “tighten” the skin and muscles of the  face is unproven.  If anything, the “improvements” shown in the pictures from the company are related to mild tissue trauma and inflammation with resulting swelling that puffs up the area and improves the appearance of the lines and wrinkles on a very temporary basis. Frequent treatments are therefore necessary, and there are no long term benefits.  This one of many “alternatives” to a face lift that is mostly hype and false hope. (Michael F. McGuire, MD, FACS (in memoriam), Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<em>Microcurrent facials are not comparable to a facelift</em><p>There have not been any studies that prove that Facial Microcurrent treatments lead to long-term (more than a few months) tightening or lifting of skin or muscles. For this reason alone, it is not comparable to a facelift.</p><p>Many people enjoy microcurrent facials because it can provide some temporary improvement in skin quality, so it is great in a series of treatments before a big event. However, the results are subtle. (Sarmela Sunder, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Micro-current Facial versus Surgical Facelift Differences</h4><p>Skin cell function may be modified by the use of micro-current, galvanic or electrotherapy. This may expose the filler gel molecules to change or break-down or greater exposure to a immune response. Maintain good hygiene to the area injected and do not manipulate the filler until it has set.<br>

<p>In my opinion, this is merely a gimmick that has not been clinically proven and offers no advantage above a traditional facelift (Michael E. Kelly, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Marketing ahead of science</h5><p>I think most of the marketed “facelift” techniques that are minimally invasive lack any data to support its results. I would be very cautious. (Sergio Alvarez, MD, Doral Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Not a facelift</i></p><p>Facial microcurrent is not a facelifting technique. Whatever ‘results’ you will see, will be short-lived at best. There is no substitute for a well-performed facelift, that is comprehensive, and anatomically well planned. (Nirav Savalia, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<em>Microcurrent? Facelift? Apples and Oranges</em><p>Micro current treatments and fillers like Juvederm most likely can proceed in parallel. (A little electrical humor for you!). I don’t believe that has been studied. What draws my attention to your question is the phrase Microcurrent Facelift.</p><p>Modest improvements in skin quality and facial muscle tone are alleged with Microcurrent, but to hijack the term ‘facelift’, is misleading. This leads patients to spend money on treatments that don’t work or underperform. If Microcurrent had a legion of happy patients, there would be a separate subject line on ReaSelf.com.</p><p>Treatments that work rise in exposure in the marketplace. Time will tell. (Luke J. Curtsinger, MD, FACS, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Microcurrent treatments and injectable fillers</em></p><p>There is no scientific information on whether or not the micro current treatments will breakdown your injectable fillers.</p><p>We know from laser studies on fillers that they do not affect fillers negatively or cause them to break down. I don’t think that the energy from the micro currents is as powerful as laser or radiofrequency skin tightening devices so I would think its safe and ok to have the procedure performed.</p><p>If you are interested, you may want to look into other devices that have been studied more extensively. Examples: Ultherapy (ultrasound), Thermage (unipolar RF), Smart Lipo and Laser Lifts (laser assisted tightening). Again, none of these perform better than facelifts. (Ran Y. Rubinstein, MD, Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Microcurrent is not a effective as we would hope.</b></p><p>Microcurrent has been around for decades and is supposed to lift the face by stimulating the facial muscles. The only problem is that the muscles are not the cause of the appearance of aging. It’s pretty much everything else.</p><p>I have a lot of experience with a wide variety of non-surgical devices that can improve a person’s facial appearance, and they all are only capable of making rather mild improvements. So, in a nut shell, microcurrent can not give you results like a facelift can. (Andrew Campbell, MD, Milwaukee Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
