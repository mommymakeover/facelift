<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The cost of a french facelift varies greatly depending on the technique employed, areas addressed and geographical location.</p><p>In the Los Angeles area, a facelift can cost anywhere from $8,000 to $40,000.</p><p>What is more important than the actual dollar amount of a french facelift is the value of the surgery.</p><p>What one surgeon calls a “French Facelift” is not necessarily what another surgeon calls a “French Facelift.”</p><p>In some practices, the whole face (including forehead, eyes, cheeks, jawline and neck) is addressed with a facelift. While in other practices, a french facelift involves rejuvenating the lower part of one’s face and neck.</p><p>The technique used is critical to the final result and the longevity of the lift. These factors vary from surgeon to surgeon and affect the cost as well. (Sarmela Sunder, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6018" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Depends on who is performing it for you</h3><p>French facelifts are offered by a wide range of physicians, not just Plastic Surgeons. A face lift done by a non-plastic surgeon or even non-SURGEON will probably cost less, and for good reason. Many people have taken a course or just decided to teach themselves how to do a facelift.</p><p>In the end, the details that need to be attended to by a TRAINED AND EXPERIENCED PLASTIC SURGEON will be ignored. These details include but are not limited to scars, how the skin is redraped, problems with ears being “pulled”, infections, using wrong suture material, asymmetry, medical issues, after-care, wrong procedure chosen. etc.</p><p>Getting your face lift done by a Plastic Surgeon who has EXPERIENCE in the procedure might cost more than the average, but the difference you pay is visible in the quality and longevity of the result.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6019" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Even an inexperienced “surgeon” may have 2 to 3 “good” results to show you. But the experienced Plastic Surgeon can usually show you 20 or more patients with “great” results. (M. Sadi Erfani, MD, La Jolla Physician)</p><h3>Cost Not Top Priority</h3><p>The cost your your french facelift needs to be on your list of questions, but should not be on the top of the list. A properly performed first procedure will always cost less than a second revision surgery. More important is to find a surgeon who specializes in the face and who performs hundreds of facelifts per year. You cannot put a price on your boosted self-esteem and own personal satisfaction that masterfully performed cosmetic procedures can provide.</p><p>Having a cosmetic procedure is a unique personal decision. Instead of hunting for a bargain, your procedure(s) should be viewed as an investment in yourself. Just as important, you do not necessarily have to pay an extraordinary amount in order to achieve results that provide long-term gratification.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6020" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Educating yourself about the characteristics of a skilled surgeon, his team, the benefits possible with variations of different procedures, and the associated expenses will allow you to determine how to maximize the most of your self-investment. (Paul Lanfranchi, DO, FAOCO, Las Vegas Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>More than you might think!</strong></p><p>If you choose a french facelift based on price rather than reputation and qualification, you risk your facelift costing you embarrassment and disappointment. I strongly believe that you should check the prices of several plastic surgeons who have appropriate qualifications and good reputations as paying more does not equate to getting a better result and some of the “outliers” who cost twice as much as the median, produce no better results.</p><p>A phone call to their office will get you an answer. Be sure you are comparing “like with like”: eg consider whether eyelids and brow are included in the price quoted. Don’t skimp on the facility.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6021" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c7b3e0b9854ed013c1592278f6f706f4">

</div><p>An accredited facility can be a life saver as they come with extensive resuscitation facilities as standard. Don’t complain about paying for an anaesthetist.</p><p>They are there to look after your heart and lungs while the surgeon is busy with your surgery.</p><p>Only have a french facelift if it is easily within your budget. It isn’t necessary for your health or wellbeing. There can always be extra costs from other doctors and hospitals if things go wrong and if you have just enough for the facelift, you can be left short. (Dan Kennedy, MBBS, FRACS (plast), Brisbane Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Facelift expense ranges depending on the technique performed and if it can be accomplished under a local or general anesthesia.</p><p>When performed in an accredited facility the expenses include the surgeon’s fee, anesthesia fee, and operating room costs.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6022" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>As far as the technique involved, the more extensive the facelift the more expensive one becomes. Typically, in my practice in Northern California Peninsula region, I will perform a “lift and fill” type of surgery.</p><p>This includes a deep plane facelift, neck lift, and then fat transfer to add lost volume to the face. It takes quite a bit of time to perform this and the facelift can range from $10,000 to $25,000.</p><p>This includes all of the expenses as mentioned above plus an overnight fee for observation in the hospital. The end result will address each patient’s issues at hand. Browlift may also be performed at the same time as well as eyelid surgery.</p><p>You should seek a Board Certified Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeon who performs a number of facelifts yearly in your area to review your concerns. (Joel B. Beck, MD, FACS, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6023" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>When comparing the price of facelfit surgery please note that multiple factors can influence the bottom line:geographic locationindividual surgeon pricing within a given geographic locationexact nature and type of surgery that is being performed as part of the ‘facelift’ procedure (midface, lower face, neck, submentoplasty, depth and extent of dissection).</p><p>As most surgeons will recommend, do not use pricing as a major determinant in deciding where to have your surgery. (Mario J. Imola, MD, DDS, Denver Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>French lift cost varies by geographic location.</p><h3>Factors that influence cost are:</h3><ol>
<li>surgeon’s fee;</li>
<li>anesthesia fees;</li>
<li>facility fees.</li>
</ol><p>You may wish to consult with several surgeons prior to making your decision. At the same time, select a surgeon whom you feel comfortable with, one who is board-certified and is able to show you multiple before and after photos of patients with similar concerns. (Anand G. Shah, MD, San Antonio Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6024" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><strong>Facelift costs</strong></p><p>There is undoubtedly huge variation in the cost of french facelift surgery as the term is used to describe several different types of procedure. These different operations take a different banks of time in the operating theatre and require different levels of follow-up.</p><p>In addition, surgeons have variable overhead costs to take into account based on geographical position, staffing levels, insurance et cetera. (James Murphy, FRCS(Plast), Manchester Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of a french facelift includes the professional fee, the cost of a surgery facility with nurse and surgical technician staff members, and often the cost of an anesthesiologist. Costs vary depending on what is being done and who is doing the surgery.</p><p>That being said, the total costs in the San Francisco Bay Area are in the range of $7000-$15,000. (Elliott B. Lavey, MD, Danville Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6025" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>The cost of a facelift varies greatly – as does its value. Part of the complexity compounding this is the multitude of not only surgical techniques, but marketing techniques. To answer the question, it can range anywhere from $7,000 to as high as $30,000 or more.</p><p>Much of this depends upon the expertise and reputation of the surgeon. I would be weary of ‘discount’ facelifts, or any facelift being offered by a non-plastic surgeon. (Bryan Correa, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Cost of french facelift</h5><p>First of you should never decide on a doctor based on price! Always have a consultation and spend time reviewing that doctor’s B& A photos. Never chose a doctor who only shows you a couple of photos.</p><p>Prices can vary depending on the add ons such as CO2 laser, fat transfer, blepharoplasty, cervicoplasty, etc.., For the basic facelift I have seen fees range from $7000 to as high as $20,000. Don’t think if you pay more you are necessarily getting a better job.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_6026" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c7b3e0b9854ed013c1592278f6f706f4">

</div><p>It’s about experience and asking around. Make sure you are comfortable with the doctor before proceeding. (Jeffrey Marvel, MD, Nashville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The price of a french facelift depends on your geographic location, the skill and experience of your surgeon, and the specific details of the procedure you wish to have performed (for example, facelift, necklift, and any adjunctive procedures). (Lara Devgan, MD, MPH, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I charge $8000 surgical fee for a traditional facelift. There would be an additional fee for the surgicenter and anesthesia which is about $2000.</p><p>I do many mini-facelifts in my office which cost about $7000 total. (Jonathan Pontell, MD, FACS, Philadelphia Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>How Much Does a Facelift Cost?</h4><p>The cost of a french facelift varies by city and region. It’s important to determine what is included in the cost of the procedure. Typically the quote includes the surgeon’s fee, operating room fee, and anesthesiology fee.</p><p>The price also includes postoperative care. A common range would be between 10-20k. Consider getting several opinions from surgeons in your area. This will allow you to hear each of their thoughts on what procedures you may need.</p><p>It’s best to make decisions based on quality, and not solely on price. You may find that some surgeons perform different styles of facelift or adjunct procedures at the time of a french facelift procedure. This may include things like fat grafting to the face, which can enhance the result of a french facelift.</p><p>As with any important decision doing research and visiting multiple surgeons will be to your benefit as you explore a cosmetic procedure.
