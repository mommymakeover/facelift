If you have the changes that a face lift will improve – now is the time!</p><p>Facelift surgery is most effective for treating saggy jowls and loose skin especially in the chin and neck region. These are common occurrences with the aging process. These changes also do not occur at any particular age.</p><p>I have performed first facelifts on patients in their 30s and others don’t require a facelift until they are in their 60s. If you are looking in a mirror and using your hands to pull your jowls up back towards your ears, you may be a candidate.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3985" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d8ace6a67b21721f2ef7d633adea7cca">

</div><p>An experienced surgeon will inform you about all aspects of the surgery including expected results and also how long you as an individual would be expected to keep those results. (George Volpe, MD, Newton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Patient selection for facelifts should be done in tandemn with your PS</i></p><p>Individuals age at different rates so there’s no set age, at which you should consider a facelift. In contrast to my father’s patients, my facelift patients are about a decade younger.</p><p>The rationale for this is multifactorial: greater acceptance of cosmetic surgery, increased number of providers (surgeons) and consumers (patients), global commoditization of beauty and youth, etc.</p><p>When you feel you are ready, interview at multiple practices, define your objections and ensure that your health, recovery time and aesthetic sensibilities are respected by your PS. (Lavinia K. Chong, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The right time for a facelift is when you have aging changes that bother you and are too substantial to address with lesser methods. (Neck banding, jowling, dropped cheeks, etc.) In most cases, the early 50’s is a good time to undertake the procedure, as that is when most of the noticeable aging changes have started to take place (Thomas A. Pane, MD, Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3986" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-474bed6606b0b2723834c22d95c9930c">

</div><p>Many people are seeking facelifts at earlier ages than ever before. And the younger you get the procedure, the more subtle the changes will be and the longer your lift will last. That said, the right time for a facelift is more about the look of your face than the chronological age.</p><p>I suggest that you consult with a single or board certified facial plastic surgeon. (Ross A. Clevens, MD, Melbourne Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You are certainly right in the main age group for a facelift if you have the need for one. Please seek advice from only the top facelift surgeons to get the best result without looking operated on. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Ideal Age for Facelift</h3><p>It’s not so much your age but rather how much sagginess, wrinkles and loss of volume of your face that you have that determines the ideal time to start thinking about a facelift. I find that patients are having facelifts at a younger age (before 55) now then maybe a decade ago.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3987" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d0c1fda4d7475f374f521bc49f94d14f">

</div><p>I definitely feel that the younger you are the better quality skin/ skin elasticity you have at the time of surgery, the longer the results will last. Just makes sense because the older you are the thinner and more loose your skin is.</p><p>You can tighten it as much as you need to and get it to look really nice on the OR, but if your skin quality is not good to start with, your skin will start to sag again a lot faster.</p><p>Also, the more loose skin you have the more difficult the surgery will be to get rid of all that, the more “different” you will look (maybe so much that your friends will have a harder time recognizing you).</p><p>If you do a facelift at a younger age it won’t be quite as drastic an improvement and will thus look more “natural” especially if you have some volume replacement at the same time (with fat transfers) so we won’t need to pull as much with the facelift.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3988" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>This will also allow your results to last longer. Also when you have the procedure at a younger age, you would be healthier and will thus recover faster (and you will be younger and more active and will be able to enjoy your more youthful experience longer).</p><p>I would recommend that you see several board certified plastic surgeons that have a lot of experience with facial rejuvenation to get their recommendations. .</p><p>(Bao L. Phan, MD, Honolulu Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Age is not much of a criteria. It really is simply when the benefits outweigh the risks for any individual who is motivated for the change that can be reasonably expected. Often, earlier on fillers and Botox like products can provide pleasing changes without surgery.</p><p>Once surgery is “indicated”, that is the time. (Robert H. Hunsaker, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3989" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-ec3ee9ea3da410c5b0549d34aea65783">

</div><p>Age is not a factor for a facelift but the condition of the skin and muscle. Different parts of the face age at different rates. For some patients, they may have their eyes done in their 40’s and a brow lift in their late 40’s or early 50’s and a lower facelift in their mid 50’s or early 60’s.</p><p>Each patient is individual and needs to be evaluated by a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. (Miguel Delgado, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Age to Consider a Facelift</strong></p><p>Anatomy, not your age, will determine the timing of a facelift. If you anatomy has changed, then it can be enhanced to restore balance and harmony to the face. The early a patient has a facelift, the easier it is for a surgeon to get a great result, the less aggressive the surgery, and quicker the recovery.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3990" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>This is an elective procedure, so listen your gut and follow your own timeline. (Jonathan Kulbersh, MD, Charlotte Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Although early 50s are a good age to be considered, there is no right age for the procedure. If you have jowling, loose neck skin and a poorly defined jaw line, you may be a candidate for a facelift.</p><p>Be sure to consult with an experienced board certified plastic surgeon. (Zachary Farris, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Discuss Your Treatment Plan With Your Plastic Surgeon</b></p><p>Knowing when to get a cosmetic procedure can be just as challenging as choosing the right one for you. Having an in-depth discussion with your board-certified plastic surgeon regarding when you should get the procedure you want is the first place to start.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3991" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Because everyone’s needs and aesthetic goals are different, each procedure will be unique in regards to:</p><ul>
<li>Timing</li>
<li>Techniques and tools used</li>
<li>Recovery time</li>
</ul><p>Your plastic surgeon will recommend best procedures as well as the best time to get them done.</p><p>Be sure to do your research so you are choosing the right treatment option to get the look you want to achieve. (Michael F. McGuire, MD, FACS (in memoriam), Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The bottom line is that you should consult with a reputable real board certified plastic surgeon who is experienced in this type of surgery and with whom you feel comfortable and confident.</p><p>There is not a specific age recommended for a facelift it truly depends on the individual and how they have been affected by the aging process. If you feel that you may benefit from a facelift I would recommend an in person exam to discuss your goals and candidacy. (Leonard Lu, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3992" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>You want to get the procedure done when you get to the point that the benefits you see in your surgeon’s photos are worth the cost he/she charges.</p><p>The youngest patient I’ve done a deep plane lift on was in her late thirties and the oldest was a very robust 82 year old, that’s over 25 years of doing nothing but faces.</p><p>As long as you are mentally and physically well, can afford the procedure and think the results of the surgery that your surgeon produces are worth the cost then you are ready. (M. Sean Freeman, MD, Charlotte Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There is no defined age that is best for having a facelift because there are many variables that contribute to the aging process. And there are many physical attributes that contribute to the aged look.</p><p>Ages 50-65 are probably the most common for surgical rejuvenation. A visit with a facial plastic surgeon can help you determine if a facelift surgery is right for you.<br>
(Sean R. Weiss, MD, FACS, New Orleans Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Since the extent of a facelift can be tailored to the patient’s needs, when you do a facelift is determined by when you feel you would like it. In short there is not benefit to waiting until one is old enough to justify a ‘full’ facelift approach. (Barry L. Eppley, MD, DMD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>When to do a facelift is not exactly an age thing, you should consider it if there is sagging tissue that is not correctable with fillers or fat grafting alone. Some patients need it in their 40s, others need it later. (Peter T. Truong, MD, Fresno Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3994" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-83e6c35ef7b5f8984a37bb8ce108c0bb">

</div><p>Whether or not you should have a facelift depends upon your individual condition. In general, 51 years old is not “too young” to consider a facelift, and incredible results come from considering the right procedure at this age. (Brian K. Machida, MD, FACS, Ontario Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There really is not a specific time in terms of age that is correct to do a facelift. It really depends on you and your specific aging. It also obviously depends on other medical problems or overall health.</p><p>It can be very appropriate to do a facelift on someone quite a bit younger or quite a bit older than 51 years old. Different people age differently based on many factors including genetics, sun exposure, smoking, weight loss, et cetera.</p><p>Also, people may get to where they do not feel that their facial aging appears how they would like it to, at different points in their life age wise. I like to have a good discussion including all of the above factors when I meet with a patient to discuss facial rejuvenation.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3995" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-2984ce0bd9766530ee6db3180fe2b84d">

</div><p>I would recommend consulting with a board certified plastic surgeon to go over all of this. I also feel that a surgeon who is a member of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery has taken additional steps as someone who is further interested in cosmetic surgery. (Hampton Alexander Howell, MD, Winston Salem Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The best age for a facelift depends upon the individual patient, the aging process, sun exposure, skin elasticity and the patient’s perspective regarding waiting to the last possible moment or tightening their face and lifting the muscles earlier rather than later.</p><p>A face-to-face meeting with a board-certified plastic surgeon will give you the option of being assessed and advised as to your best approach. 51 is slightly early but it is not that unusual for someone with jowls or a droopy neck to wish to look rejuvenated. (Jon A. Perlman, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Best Age for a Facelift</b></p><p>While age is always considered there’re many other much more important factors to be considered when evaluating a patient for facial rejuvenation such as skin type, sagging of the skin, laxity of the underlying facial and neck muscles, and last but not least what are the patient’s alternatives. (Richard W. Fleming, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Best age to consider a Facelift </strong></p><p>There is no specific age to consider a facelift because people age at different rates depending on genetics and lifestyle. How you view your appearance also plays a large role. Commonly many people start to think about their age when they see themselves in pictures or the mirror and find that they look older than they thought.</p><p>This is often compounded by milestone birthday. Many people start to show changes that can be improved with a facelift during their mid to late forties and start thinking about it when they turn fifty.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3993" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-474bed6606b0b2723834c22d95c9930c">

</div><p>If you see changes in your lower face and neck that improve with lifting and tightening the skin, you may be a good candidate. Although improvement in appearance is possible at older ages, the results can be more satisfying before the tissues have lost their elasticity.</p><p>There are many types of facelifts and many less invasive options to rejuvenate the face. In my opinion it is best to think of rejuvenation as an ongoing maintenance program and select the appropriate procedure that does not not over correct the problem.</p><p>You must also consider the risks of each procedure. Board certification ensures that your doctor has knowledge of available techniques. The experience of your doctor with the procedure is also very important. (Stephen Fink, DO FAOCO, Newport Beach Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There is no specific age for a facelift. It depends on your individual face and what you would like improved. A facelift will improve sagging of the cheeks, jowls and neck in addition to sagging of the smile lines around the mouth.</p><p>If you are a candidate for a facelift, you will get better results if you have a facelift when you are younger (earlier in the aging process) and you will get to enjoy the results for longer!
