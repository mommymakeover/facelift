</div><p>Any woman wants to stay young and beautiful as long as possible. And for this there are a lot of ways that will allow a short time to return the skin to youth. Cosmetologists advise to resort to the help of rejuvenating techniques after 30 years old, not earlier.</p><h3>Indications</h3><p>Non-surgical methods will be helpful for those who do not want to lie under the surgeon’s knife. Nevertheless, this method is suitable only for the so-called deformation type of aging. With this type, the face begins to gradually subside, eyebrows drop, a second chin and fine wrinkles appear.<br>
But with a fine-wrinkled type of aging, when the entire face is covered with a fine mesh of wrinkles, only plastic surgery is suitable.</p><h3>Contraindications</h3><p>Despite the fact that non-surgical facelift is safe, it has a number of contraindications. It is better to abandon the procedure for pregnancy, herpes, eczema, acute inflammatory processes on the skin, cancer, etc. In some cases, procedures are not performed for blood diseases and diseases of the cardiovascular system.</p><h3>Pros and cons</h3><p></p>

</div>Facelift without surgery is one of the most popular cosmetic procedures. But any of these procedures have both advantages and disadvantages.
<p>Among the obvious advantages of non-surgical methods of rejuvenation, experts note the following:</p><ul>
<li>Absence of a large number of contraindications;</li>
<li>Absence of side effects;</li>
<li>A short period of recovery;</li>
<li>Result after the first session;</li>
<li>Improving effect for the whole organism;</li>
<li>The possibility of performing the procedure on an outpatient basis.</li>
</ul><p>Many women who successfully practice non-surgical methods of rejuvenation, note that their only drawback is a painful sensation. And it is true that during some procedures, for example, mesolifting, you can feel slight discomfort. If the patient has a low pain threshold and can not tolerate pain, anesthetics are used during the procedure.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1334" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Types of facelift without surgery</h3><p>Thanks to modern technology, you can easily “remove” fine wrinkles and scars, and tighten facial contours. But there are a lot of these methods and all of them fulfill their special function. Some types are suitable for any type of skin, while others may not have the desired effect. Therefore, before you go to a cosmetology center, you should decide on the type of facelift.</p><h3>Hardware facelift</h3><p>This type of rejuvenation without surgery is based on the use of ultrasound, current and laser radiation. All procedures are carried out with the help of special devices and only by experienced specialists.</p><h3>Ultrasound facelift with SMAS-effect.</h3><p>During ultrasonic facelift, the ultrasonic wave acts on the skin in such a way that collagen fibers are reduced and their synthesis starts. Due to this, the skin is renewed, and this process is stretched for several months.</p><h3>Laser facial rejuvenation</h3><p>This method of rejuvenation can also be called one of the most effective.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1335" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

Radio Frequency face lift is absolutely painless method of rejuvenation, which allows one to achieve stunning results in one session. Rejuvenation occurs due to an electric current in the radio frequency range, the pulses of which warm the skin cells, providing a lifting effect.</p><h3>Plasma Lift</h3><p>This technique is based on the subcutaneous injection of the patient’s blood plasma. This happens as follows: the specialist conducts blood sampling from the patient and passes it through a special centrifuge. There, it breaks up into a plasma rich in platelets and a mass rich in eritrotsitami. It is the plasma that is injected under the skin, triggering all the processes of cell rejuvenation.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1336" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">
