<li>poor patient selection (thick heavy skin, too much laxity, too much fat)</li>
<li>the treatment is overly hyped and so expectations are too high</li>
<li>the treatment is poorly done (too few pulses, wrong vectors etc.)</li>
<li>use of the old Thermage instead of the new Thermage CPT</li>
</ul><p>No non-invasive device will ever deliver the same degree of result as a surgical procedure but for patients who do not want surgery, I have not yet seen a better alternative than the Thermage CPT.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1951" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Montreal, where I practice, has a very demanding patient population and the proof that the CPT is well-accepted is that, unlike with the old Thermage, many of our patients are referring their friends. (Arie Benchetrit, MD, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Thermage Works</i></p><p>Thermage works great when done by an experienced practitioner who chooses patient selection wisely. To date, this is still the best non-surgical form of skin tightening we have seen.</p><p>However, there are many variables that are practitioner dependent that can make Thermage not work.</p><p>#1. <strong>Patient Selection is key</strong> – patients should only have mild to moderate laxity. Any more laxity then this patients will not see a good result.</p><p>#2. <strong>You must do an adequate number of pulses at a high enough energy</strong>. Many Practitioners are not doing a thorough treatment – doing either too few pulses or at too low an energy. For a full face I would expect a minimum of 900 full pulses using a 3cm CPT tip.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1943" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-5729eadb6841f812a47a108d82e9cd34">

</div><p>#3. <strong>Tip Placement</strong>– your Physician should have a good knowledge of proper placement of the pulses. It should be done in vectors to properly lift and tighten the sagging skin.</p><p>#4. <strong>Outdated Equipment</strong> – The newest Thermage does not hurt. It is virtually painless. The new CPT Software and tip have a vibratory mechanism. Be sure to only go to a Physician who has invested in the newest technology – this will give you optimal results. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Expect subtle results from Thermage</h3><p>Thermage, like other non-invasive treatments, produces subtle changes. Therefore, patients who desire more significant results will generally be dissatisfied with the outcome even though it has virtually no down-time.</p><p>The key, as others have indicated, is careful patient selection and understanding of the benefits and limitations of the treatment.</p><p>For a relatively young patient who is not emotionally or financially ready for facial rejuvenation surgery, the older patient who is not a good medical candidate for invasive procedures, or one seeking a modest improvement, it’s a reasonable option. (Robert L. Kraft, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1944" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-0297449e47bc5b26dc0b885dffcb9392">

</div><p><strong>Cellulite can be treated by thermage</strong></p><p>some, not all patients, have reported good reslts with cellulite after treatment by thermage and the new cellulite protocol and equipment. it’s not a guarantee but there is enough improvement in some cases to warrant a try.</p><p>there is no cure for cellulite and the treatment may continue as a maintenance in the years ahead..(Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Thermage works.</em></p><p>I am a Plastic Surgeon so surgery is certainly an option I offer my patients when it’s appropriate. As a Plastic Surgeon it’s not necessarily good for business to tell you that Thermage works…but it does…however, it is not a facelift and will not give you the results that a facelift will give you. If your issues are severe, then a significant treatment is indicated.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1945" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>But, if your issues are mild, then Thermage is certainly a minimally invasive way to get an improvement that you could only otherwise get with surgery.</p><p>I perform Thermage CPT as part of a series with three other skin tightening modalities and patients tend to be happy. Should I as a surgeon sound positive that I can make a patient happy without surgery? That’s a whole different discussion! (Scott E. Newman, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Thermage CPT vs. Blepharoplasty for Lower Lids</b></p><p>Personally, I doubt that Thermage will give you meaningful improvement for lower lid aging.</p><p>It is the combination of shape and coverage that distinguishes a youthful lower lid region: The transition from cheek to lower lid should be soft and convex, the coverage should be made of smooth skin.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1946" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If it is only skin that is the concern (which it rarely is), a skin-only blepharoplasty can be entertained.</p><p>Alternative, skin resurfacing (laser, peel) could be discussed but remember that the treatment has to go deep enough to cause enough skin tightening for fine wrinkles to improve.</p><p>Most commonly, volume loss, fat excess and skin wrinkling go hand in hand. The most important step is the initial analysis of your particular condition.</p><p>See an experienced facial plastic surgeon for a thorough evaluation which should be followed by a personalized plan. (Frank P. Fechner, MD, Worcester Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Chemical Peel, CO2 Laser, or Surgical Blepharoplasty are more proven </b></p><p>I am not aware of any good scientific studies that demonstrate Thermage treatments to be an alternative to Blepharoplasty or Chemical Peel of the lower lids. The procedures mentioned in the title bar are all proven and your surgeon should be skilled in all of these areas so that the appropriate choice can be made in an effort to tighten the skin of your lower lid area.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1947" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>Be sure and find someone who does a lot of these procedures and has all of the tools in their tool box. If the only tool they have is a hammer (Thermage CPT) then you will definitely look like a nail! (S. Randolph Waldman, MD, Lexington Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Thermage is a radiofrequency treatment that produces mild to modest improvement in laxity</em></p><p>Thermage CPT is a radiofrequency treatment that produces a deep heat in the tissue. I have seen mild to modest improvement with this treatment. Another option for laxity of the skin might be the fractionated lasers or other resurfacing lasers depending on your skin type and color. (Lenore Sikorski, MD, Orange County Dermatologist)</p><h5>Thermage is insufficient</h5><p>Thermage CPT has been touted as an alternative to surgery. However, it provides only minimal tightening of the skin. If your skin is very saggy, blepharoplasty is a much better option. If you have only tiny wrinkles, Thermage CPT might be helpful.</p><p>Botox is also useful for the “crows feet” at the corners of the eyes. The best way to determine what you need is to see a plastic surgeon for an evaluation. Be sure to stress what bothers you the most, and what you would like to see changed. (Nina S. Naidu, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Thermage CPT patient reviews</h3><p>“I’m Glad I Invested in This Treatment, Worth Every Penny!”</p><p>Amazing! I’m glad I invested in this treatment, it was worth every penny! The technician was very knowledgable and comforting. My treatment took about an hour and immediately after it the sking around my eyes felt tight and looked smooth. I am very happy with the result, and recommanded to my family and friends.<br>
SK</p><p>“I Would Love to Do It Again”</p><p>” I had thermage done a couple of months ago on my face and neck at Sue DeCotiis’ office. The whole procedure took about 1 1/2 hrs. and the area of biggest results seems to be my neck. I had started to see signs of wrinkling and loose skin on my neck and now it feels soft and my neck looks so much better. I also feel like my face is more youthful and softer. I would definitely recommend this procedure and would love to continue with it on my eyes, chest, legs and abdomen. I would love to do it again.”</p><p>Amazing! I’m glad I invested in this treatment, it was worth every penny! The technician was very knowledgable and comforting. My treatment took about an hour and immediately after it the sking around my eyes felt tight and looked smooth. I am very happy with the result, and recommanded to my family and friends.</p><p>“Great experience, I’m very handsome again :)” </p></div>
