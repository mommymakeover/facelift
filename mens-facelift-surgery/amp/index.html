<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Performing a facelift on a Man is different than doing one on a woman. The anatomy is different and there are specific details that must not be overlooked for a great result.</p><p>The incisions are placed differently due to the hairline and also the lack of hair in certain places. The male face is larger than a woman’s face and there is also the aspect of a beard.</p><p>All these aspects make the face more challenging and the detail is important. The other aspect is knowing how to deal with the neck. Men need a sharp neck and jawline and there are certain surgical maneuvers that must be performed to achieve this.</p><p>The surgeon must be competent in these maneuvers. There are other features that are needed as well and the list goes on and on.<br>

</div>Face lift in men is less forgiving for several reasons: one is that the incisions are harder to hide, two is because a man looks good with a few wrinkles anyway and three men have much less time to recuperate so the technique needs to me meticolous.
<p>There is nothing worse then seeing a man with an overdone look!Also and very important the other ancillary procedures which are usually done along with the face lift like blepharoplasty need to be specially customized.</p><p>In summary, the philosophy of male facelift is a more conservative approach: less is definitely more in men!</p><p><i>Facelifts for Men: Possible & Popular</i></p><p>Although men and women generally have different aesthetic preferences (most men want a strong, square jaw, for example, while women are drawn to more delicate features), the primary goal of facelift surgery for a person of either sex is to look younger.</p><p>Because women still make up the majority of a plastic surgeon’s patient base, it’s important to seek out a surgeon who has demonstrated mastery of male facelift surgery and understands that these patients have different needs, preferences, and concerns than women.<br>

</div>Take a look at a surgeon’s before-and-after photos to ensure they include a mix of men and women, and pay attention to how the results differ from patient to patient. While facelift scars are generally very discreet for patients with short hair, they may still be visible if a man is totally bald.
<p>A good surgeon will offer you guidelines for caring for your incision after surgery to ensure an inconspicuous scar. </p><p>Facelift surgery for men does entail different considerations, when compared to female facelift. Overall aesthetic goals as well as incision placement may differ. Hairline considerations must be accounted for. Select a surgeon whom you feel comfortable with, one who is able to show you multiple before and after photos of male patients.</p><p>Men get facelifts all the time, mainly because they don’t like the neck! Many men develop a fatty, droopy and redundant neck with time and they are looking to restore a more natural and aesthetic neck profile.<br>

</div>A neck lift is usually combined with a lower face lift and the procedure is usually the same as the one women get except for a few modifications. Male pattern baldness should not affect the appearance of the scars since there is usually hair present behind the ear to which the scar usually extends.
<p>However, men who have absolutely no hair and plan on shaving their head all the time should be prepared to accept a visible scar that will show behind the ear. The scar usually fades with time.</p><p>Another important factor to consider in men is that some of their beard (hair-bearing neck skin) will be pulled and moved behind the ears during the procedure and they will have to extend their daily shave to that area. </p><p>The basic incision for a male facelift is the same as that for females. The incisions around the ear are made on the ear and within the ear canal so they are not seen after surgery.<br>

</div>We do not want patients of either sex to rely on hair styling to hide an incision. The vector of skin elevation is different in men to maintain normal facial hair distribution. 
<p>Approximately 20% of facelift patients are men. Incisions are slightly modified to follow the natural hairline on a man. Other slight modifications include the direction of pull, which is more vertical in a man than a woman.</p><p>The incisions must be very meticulously sewn together so that there is minimal scarring. We have performed facelifts on completely bald men without any problems. The scars are virtually imperceptible. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Men are usually very accepting and happy with their results (as much as the women). As well, it is important that the men look natural and manly.<br>

</div>They should not look artificial or surgical. The results are technique dependent. Incision lines (scar lines) can be camouflaged or hidden in a natural way so that they may be ultimately inconspicuous. The techniques I employ in men are not substantially different from those that I use for women. (Sigmund L. Sattenspiel, MD, Freehold Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<h5>Male facelifts differ from women but can be very sucessful</h5><p>There are a number of differences in the facelift procedure between men and women. A few of these differences are placement of the incisions, potential longer healing time and less tolerance to actually sitting still and healing.</p><p>The incisions depend on your beard pattern. With laser hair techniques, I prefer to place the incision behind the tragus (small square cartilage in front of the ear) and use laser to re-establish a small hairless strip in front of the ear.<br>

</div>Men want to have surgery and get back to work faster. Unfortunately, due to increased blood supply from the beard, black and blue can last even longer than in women. Yet men typically look to take off even less time.
<p>Since they are unlikely to wear cover makeup and don’ t usually want people around them to know they had surgery, they may need to take even more time off before returning to work. (Steven J. Pearlman, MD, New York Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Male facelift differences from women.</b></p><p>Preservation of the sideburn, placement of the incision inside the ear, removing beard hair from the skin closure and behind the ear are some of the differences. See an experienced facelift surgeon so you don’t have that “done” look.<br>

</div><h3>Male facelifts, unique aspects</h3><p>Men suffer sagging jowls and loose skin under the chin as they age, and just as in women, there is no way to diet and excercise the loose skin away. A well performed facelift, or neck lift, can make a substantial improvement in one’s appearance.</p><p>Expertise in placement of the incision must be considered as men generally wear their hair shorter. Usually I suggest that my male patients consider growing a beard a few weeks before the surgery, leave it on for the operation, and then they can easily hide any sign of swelling or bruising.</p><p>A well trimmed beard can be attractive and when you finally shave it off a few weeks after the surgery, people will simply notice that you shaved your beard. If your chin is a bit “soft” in appearance, a chin implant combined with a face or neck lift can make a substantial improvement in your appearance.<br>

</div>Many male celebrities have facelift surgery, unfortunately it’s only the poor results that are obvious. Paricularly with this operation, the most important part of getting a good result, is the surgeon you choose. (Darrick E. Antell, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)
<p>The male facelift differs from the female facelift due primarily to the bearded skin of men. For this reason incisions typically are in front of the ear in a crease. On the back of the ear and into the hairline the incisions are very similar.</p><p>For males, it is best to leave some depth to the nasolabial folds to avoid a pulled look since most men do not look natural if that crease is obliterated. Also, male scars tend to take longer to mature and heal and often need follow-up treatment to make sure that they are healing well.<br>

</div>That being said, the bearded skin often does an excellent job of hiding those scars during the healing process. Other than that in my opinion the procedure is otherwise the same as far as the net result and the remainder of the technique used. (Scott Trimas, MD, Jacksonville Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Face lift for men is different in many ways. The anatomy and facial features are different and also skin thickness is different. Inmen less is better and surgeon should avoid too much pull. The final point is the attention to the jaw lines and less lift around the eyes. (Kamran Khoobehi, MD, New Orleans Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Men are getting more interested in facila rejuvenation as they live longer, work longer, and in general compete with younger individuals at work and socially. The key in mens is to get a Natural result.<br>

</div>Never a “done look”. The scar do fabulous. (Richard Greco, MD, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)
<p>The beard makes a big difference vs. female face lifts. Some changes in scar placement can help hide the scars. </p><p>Men’s facelifts are quite a bit different from female facelifts. In general, surgeons are more conservative since overdoing the lift can feminize the male face. We also put the incisions at the side burns rather than in the ear canal.</p><p>The neck lift can also pull the bearded area towards to earlobe so we try to leave a cuff of non-hair-bearing skin adjacent to the lobe and destroy the hair follicles to prevent them from growing.</p><p></p>

</div>Bleeding is more of a concern both intra-op and post-op due to the increased blood flow to the thicker hair-bearing skin and the larger surface area. With specific attention to concerns of the male, excellent results can be obtained.
<p>Also, fortunately or not, it is especially important to some in the youth-oriented economy where men in their 50’s, 60’s, and even70’s looking for jobs in a recession might have an advantage by looking younger. (Robin T.W. Yuan, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Facelifts in men and women are very similar. This is especially true with the new facelift methods like the MACS Lift. There are differences, however. The biggest problem is the beard. This must be protected since the hair follicles are in the fat just under the skin, and, when the skin is elevated the beard moves.</p><p>There is also a difference in the blood supply to the skin because of the beard. The older methods of facelifting almost always put beard behind the ear. This is because they rotated the skin up and back.</p><p>Also, many people would modify the incision in front of the ear to keep from bringing the beard onto the ear, again, because the skin was moved partially backwards. There also was a hollowing of the cheek that could be feminizing.</p><p>The newer methods like the MACS Lift have almost eliminated these problems since they elevate the tissues almost straight up (from where they came) and return the fat to the cheek where it belongs. To achieve vertical lift, we have also changed the incision so that it does not go up into an area of baldness.</p><p>Even with the older methods, with modification of the technique, these problems can be overcome. (Robert T. Buchanan, MD, Highlands Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Face lifts for men are different than facelifts for women. The key to facelifts for both men and women is tailoring of the edges of the face to make the closure as inconspicuous as possible.</p><p>For men this often means limited skin removal so the closure of the face falls just in front and just behind the the ears. Redraping of the lower face and neck skin is very important as is direct liposuction of any jowling.</p><p>The midline platysmaplasty which involve improving the neck cord, is very important in the male faclift. Generally an effort needs to be made to avoid pulling hair bearing skin immediately behind the ear and onto the tragus. Men heal quite rapidly from the facelift.</p><h3>Mens Facelift Before And After:</h3><center><div class="clearfix" id="gallery-1">
