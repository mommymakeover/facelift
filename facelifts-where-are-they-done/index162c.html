<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Facelift is a standard plastic surgery procedure that can be done at a hospital or in a clinic. It can be done with you fully asleep or under sedation.</p><p>We perform our facelifts in our clinic which is actually a fully certified operating room facility (a mini hospital) and we perform facelifts under both general and IV sedation, depending on each patient’s situation.</p><p>In our situation, going to our hospital (Humber Hospital) is not ideal because in a hospital setting I do not control which anesthetist works with me, which nurses are looking after the patient, and the instruments are general, not ideal for a facelift.</p><p>At my clinic I fully control the environment which allows me to provide a safer and more efficient setting. Our results are better, risk of complications is lower in a private setting.

</div><p>Most facelifts are done in either an office base surgical facility or an outpatient ambulatory surgery center.</p><p>They are seldom done at hospitals because of the prohibitive costs involved in having cosmetic surgery done in a hospital setting. (Jose Perez-Gurri, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>A full facelift should probably be performed in an accredited outpatient surgery center.</i></p><p>Operations within a hospital proper have a slightly higher infection rate because of the no you. A properly accredited ambulatory surgery center guarantees at the credentials of all professionals are in order and certain standards of care are met. (Vincent N.

</div><h3>It Depends on How Healthy You Are</h3><p>Facelifts can be done in any of those settings. I do most facelifts in the office using local anesthesia with mild oral sedation. Patients are awake, and in most cases, this makes the procedure easier to perform.</p><p>The beauty of doing it this way is that there are none of the issues associated with general anesthesia — nausea, increased bleeding, and blood pressure issues. Your recovery is also much easier. In order to do the procedure in this fashion, the patient must be healthy.</p><p>If there are any medical issues, then I prefer to do the procedure in the hospital using either local anesthesia with sedation or general anesthesia.

</div><p><b>Facelift options hospital clinic</b></p><p>Facelifts are done in both places about equally. Choose a surgeon that you think has good experience and with whom you feel you can work comfortably and make certain you discuss the pros and cons of each.</p><p>I prefer to work in a hospital. It is nearby, very personal and is staffed with highly-trained personnel. But office-based surgical facilities have similar benefits. (J. Howell Tiller, MD, Miami Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Office based surgery is a good choice</h5><p>It is important to have surgery with a surgeon whom you trust and with his or her regular team of nurses and assistants, and familiar space, equipment & instruments. If that is the hospital, then that is the biggest advantage.</p><p>However, Having your surgery in a hospital may be more expensive, puts you at risk for getting delayed by trauma/ emergencies and other inefficiencies, potential exposure to antibiotic resistant infections sometimes seen in hospitalized patients.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3799" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The office OR that is fully certified, equipped and properly staffed is just as safe, and may be an advantage as the entire office and staff specialize in cosmetic surgery and will likely see you through preop consultation, to the procedure, and postoperative visits-continuity of care with the same staff is always an advantage. (Vaishali B. Doolabh, MD, FACS, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The Lite Lift if there’s a modified face lift that can be done in our office under local anesthetic. Lite Lift has shorter incisions, it’s less invasive, and has a much quicker recovery time.</p><p>Our best candidates are those patients, which typically are in their late 30s to 60s, that is those patients with good elasticity of their skin. Typically we always use outpatient surgery centers. (Jed H.

</div><p>A full facelift, including eyelids and neck repair can be safely performed on healthy individuals in an office-based surgery or ambulatory surgery center. The location for surgery depends on several factors, first, is your health and what type of procedure is planned, including type of anesthesia.</p><p>Second, make certain that the office facility is accredited by an inspecting agency such as Quad A-SF. Finally, inquire about your prospective surgeon’s experience in performing rhytidectomy. The combination of prudent patient, prudent surgeon and prudent surgical planning gives the patient the best possibility of an excellent, safe outcome. (Mark L. Jewell, MD, Eugene Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Facelifts are performed in many locations, accredited facilities and board-certified plastic surgeon’s will help you rest that you have chosen the safest option. Typically if the surgery is going to be done in the hospital that has to do more with the health and other medical problems that the patient may have.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3801" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c7b3e0b9854ed013c1592278f6f706f4">

Boschert, MD, Saint Louis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Where to undergo facelift surgery?</i></p><p>A full facelift is typically performed in a certified ambulatory surgical center or hospital under monitored sedation or general anesthesia, depending on patient and/ or doctor preference. All of our procedures are performed in our on site ambulatory surgical center which patients like due to anonymity, a more comfortable environment for patients and the fact that we have the same team of nurses, surgical technician and anesthesiologist working together day in and day out. (Paul M. Parker, MD, FACS, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Facelift in an accredited surgical facility</h5><p>Many plastic surgeons have an accredited surgical facility as part of their office or in the same building. Advantages of this type of facility include greater privacy, a dedicated team with a focus on the type of procedure you are having, and less exposure to sick patients.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3802" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

(Amir Nakhdjevani, MBBS, MRCS, FRCS (Plast), London Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most procedures like this are performed in in-office surgical suites. Make sure it is state approved and licensed. (William J. Welsh, MD, Nebo Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I do all my facelifts in my office surgery. Unless there are special health issues, it has provided a safe environment for over 15 years.

</div><p><strong>Safest place for facelift surgery</strong></p><p>Many surgeons may find this difficult to answer because they may have a bias due to ownership in a surgery center or in-office facility. My answer is that there are two essential components: an accredited surgical facility and the presence of a board – certified anesthesiologist (not a nurse anesthetist or PA).</p><p>I personally prefer hospitals for all significant surgery such as thisThe difficult in face lifting comes when an emergency occurs such as a heart attack or more commonly, when the neck is “opened” to have a neck lift done.</p><p>If a physician gets into airway issues or bleeding issues in the neck, this is where the situation can turn. Having an accredited facility ensures the appropriate equipment is present and usable. Having the right anesthesiologist ensures that someone knows what to do if and when things go south.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3804" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Finally, if you are not in a hospital and an emergency occurs, the staff will dial 911 in order to have you transferred to a real hospital. Make sure your surgeon is on staff at the least at a real hospital.</p><p>This ensures they have the correct privileges to do this procedure and can admit you if needed. (Samer W. Cabbabe, MD, FACS, Saint Louis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>I am planning on having a full facelift in the near future. Are such procedures typically done in office or hospital/clinic?</h4><p>I agree that your surgeon is the most important factor. However I prefer to perform a full face and neck lift in a hospital OR and admit my patients overnight. I am uncomfortable sending a patient who has had facial and neck surgery, which can impact the airway, home after the procedure.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3805" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-5c2b43db30d37388c501e254aa351542">

</div><p>Minor lifts that do not involve the neck can, in my opinion, safely be done in an outpatient setting. (Brooke R.

(Damien Grinsell, MBBS, FRACS (Plas), Melbourne Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Location for facelift surgery</i></p><p>The location will vary depending on your surgeons preference and anesthesia preference. As you can see from all the comments, it really does not make a difference how you go about doing the surgery- suffice to say, overall risks are higher with deeper levels of sedation, as you are adding anesthesia risks to the procedure.</p><p>Find someone with lots of experience and an excellent safety records and you will be fine.

</div><p><strong>Facelift in Office or Hospital/Clinic?</strong></p><p>All of these choices are appropriate. If the work is done in an office or clinic make sure that it is in a surgery center which is licensed and accredited in those facilities. (Richard W. Fleming, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Facelift…where to have it done ?</strong></p><p>Depending on where you live, cosmetic surgery should only be performed in certified office operating room, outpatient surgery center or hospital. Factors that influence the decision relate to your general health. The bottom line for all surgeons is patient safety and a surgeon can not justify putting you at risk, even if he has a certified office operating room.</p><p>Other factors are general cost, which may be considerably higher in a hospital. Before having office surgery, ask the surgeon if the facility is certified, and what type of anesthesia is administered and by whom.

</div><p>A facelift should always be performed a surgical center, not in a clinic. That surgical center should be certified and licensed, and can be located adjacent to a physician’s office or hospital. In addition, board-certified physician anesthesiologists are the most qualified to perform anesthesia in the outpatient surgical setting.</p><p>Look for a surgeon who can give you a very natural result in a is safe, private and comfortable environment. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The location of the surgery does not matter as long as the facility is fully accredited. If not, there are significant risks that you would be taking. Also, make sure that whomever is doing the procedure is fully board certified by an American Board of Medical Specialists board such as the American Board of Plastic Surgery.</p><p>The latter requires all their diplomats to operate in only accredited facilities. You did not explain what you meant by a “full Facelift.” If this includes eyes and/or brow, I would highly recommend staying overnight.</p><p>I usually encourage people having just the face and neck (a simple facelift) to stay overnight also. This is definitely the safest, and you are back to almost normal by the time you are dischargeged. (Robert T. Buchanan, MD, Highlands Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Hospital vs. surgical center/office</h5><p>Most people undergoing cosmetic procedures, including facelift surgery, are healthy with limited co-morbidities. For this reason it is usually unnecessary to have your surgery performed in a hospital where more acute and specialized care is available.</p><p>As long as the office is fully accredited (AAAASF, AAAHC, etc.) you should be fine in that setting. However, if your surgeon does his surgeries at a hospital, that is fine, too. It is more important to find a surgeon with whom you trust to do a good job.

</div><p>A facelift can be performed in either a hospital or outpatient surgery center. From my point of view, both locations can be excellent choices to undergo the surgery. Generally speaking, a facelift will be performed in an outpatient surgery center because most patients go home after surgery.</p><p>There are indications where I will only do a facelift in a hospital setting.</p><h4>These indications are:</h4><ol>
<li>When the time of surgery is over seven hours</li>
<li>When a patient has a medical condition where I feel it would be safer to do in the hospital</li>
<li>When a patient does not have a good home situation and I believe they would be better cared for by a nurse in the hospital for a night</li>

</div><h3>Face lift in office or hospital/clinic?</h3><p>For a facelift you typically have general anesthesia and have the procedure in the operating room. The operating rom can be in an office or at the hospital or clinic. Outpatient centers are typically used.</p><p>Some minor facelifts can be done with local and sedation and can be done in the office, but it sound like you are looking at something a little more involved. I recommend finding a surgeon you trust and feel comfortable with and asking what setting they recommend. (Myriam Loyo, MD, Portland Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Facelifts are done in all three of those locations. In general, the hospital is reserved for patients with more medical problems or if another facility is not available.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3811" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>It offers the most health care professionals on the off chance something were to happen but it will be the most expensive option. A surgical center will be more affordable and does have other health care providers available but it won’t have available everything you could find in a hospital.</p><p>This is where the majority of facelifts are done. There are surgeons who have their own surgical suites in the office. This offers the greatest convenience and usually the best facility price for you. If any type of anesthesia is used under than local anesthesia then the surgical suite is required to be accredited.</p><p>It is important to realize that this location has the least resources available if something were to go wrong but that is very rare, otherwise no one would be operating there. The other consideration is the type of anesthesia used.</p><p>There are surgeons who will do the entire procedure with nothing but local anesthesia. This could easily be performed in the office with minimal risk. The next option is monitored anesthesia care or MAC/twilight anesthesia where it is like a colonoscopy.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3812" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

(William Marshall Guy, MD, The Woodlands Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Facelift and operating facility</h4><p>Part of the process of selecting a plastic surgeon is asking about anesthesia, operating facilities and accreditation. The surgeon should be board certified and a member of ASAPS/ASPS ideally. The operating facility should be accredited such as AAAASF or JHACO and the anesthesia administered by CRNA or an anesthesiologist.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3813" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>These are the bare minimums you should look at. Then get a feel for the safety culture of the surgeon and office. Get a measure of experience and comfort level of the surgeon performing the procedure.</p><p>Some cases are best done at the hospital and some cases are best done not at all. I am sure you are in good hands and you are wise to ask this question. Ultimately, you will place yourself in the hands of the plastic surgeon and trust his skill and judgement in where best to perform your facelift. (Paul Watterson, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Facelift in a hospital or clinic</h5><p>Safety is of paramount importance in surgery of all kinds and just because it is cosmetic does not mean that it is sensible to cut corners when it comes to anesthesia or the facility that the surgery is performed.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3814" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Make sure that the person giving the anesthetic is a fully trained and accredited anesthetist and definitely not the surgeon who is doing the operation.

</div><p>The procedure should be done in a fully licensed ambulatory surgery center. Generally one’s affiliated with a doctors office would be better economically. Just make sure it is licensed. (Robert Brueck, MD, Fort Myers Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>FaceLift surgery is preformed in all 3 settings: office surgery suite, ASC, Hospital ORs. The costs increases in that order. The risks are equal in general terms. If over night is needed than the hospital setting better but the OR staff might not be used to the surgeon’s techniques thus increase in OR time. (Darryl J.

These may be part of a surgeon’s office, a free standing surgery center or a hospital surgery center.</p><p>For safety and good results, general anesthesia is usually used. An anesthesiologist should be supervising the anesthesia in most cases although CRNAs are also used. Find a plastic surgeon whom you feel you can trust to take good care of you. Always see a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. (Elizabeth Morgan, MD, PhD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>One thing should be made clear: facelift under local anesthesia is not safer than under sedation.

It can, but is generally prohibitively expensive and does pose a higher infection risk.

(Harry V. Wright, MD, Sarasota Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I do all my facelifts in the office. In my opinion it is superior in every aspect.

For board-certified plastic surgeons who are members of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, all plastic surgery procedures requiring anything more than a local anesthetic are performed in state or nationally certified surgical centers.</p><p>It’s been well-established that the safety of ambulatory, surgicall centers or in office AAAASF surgical suites are equivalent. The advantage of an office based surgical center is privacy, convenience, and the concept of a one stop shop where most of the faces are familiar.</p><p>Sometimes, the cost can be better controlled in office based setting. (Marc J. Salzman, MD, FACS, Louisville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Where should a facelift be done?</i></p><p>A facelift can be done in a hospital, in an outpatient surgery center, or in the office. The primary determining factor is your health. Patients with multiple medical problems need to be done in the outpatient surgicenter setting or at a hospital.</p><p>Patients wwith serious medical problems (prior heart attack, etc) should only be done in a hospital setting, and require clearance from the anesthesiologist. Motivated patients who are healthy can have their procedures done in the office.</p><p>However, these patients should be given the opportunity to have their procedure in a setting with a higher level of care. The type of anesthesia should also match the setting. We offer only local anesthesia with oral sedation in the office.</p><p>Depending on the office, and the equipment at the surgeon’s disposal, some practices may offer IV sedation in the office setting. Adequate emergency equipment, etc is necessary in such cases. (Raghu Athre, MD, Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Facelift under Local Anesthesia</em></p><p>and thank you for reaching out to the RS physician community. Facelifts can be performed under general anesthesia, IV sedation, or under local anesthesia (with oral sedation). The safest route (and most cost effective) is to have it performed under local anesthesia in your surgeon’s Center.</p><p>This method has been proven over the past decade to be arguably the best approach. That said, what is more important is to find the surgeon who you feel will do the best work for you.</p><p>If your PS prefers to perform the procedure in a hospital setting, then do it that way.

(Paul Lanfranchi, DO, FAOCO, Las Vegas Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Facelifts can be done in hospitals, outpatient surgery centers, or doctor’s offices. If you are healthy without any medical problems or only minor conditions, it is perfectly safe to undergo the procedure in an outpatient setting like a surgery center or office.</p><p>Benefits of office and outpatient surgery centers are less cost and more personalized care without sacrificing safety or quality. Hospital settings are more impersonal and their anesthesiologists may have less experience with aesthetic procedures and their anesthetic needs.
