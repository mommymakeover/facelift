<span itemprop="articleBody"><p>Lifestyle Lift usually costs about $4,000 &#8211; 6,000, depending on whether or not you have any additional procedures, such as neck liposuction, upper and/or lower lids done at the same time. The price is usually similar to the price of a mini face lift. (Stella Desyatnikova, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>There are also several financing options that are quite reasonable. As the largest plastic surgery group in the country, we have come to expect a certain amount trash talk from smaller competitors. </p>
<p>Rather than get into an unprofessional war of words, I would simply recommend that you go to your nearest Lifestyle Lift center, talk to the surgeon, see examples of their work, and form your own opinions. (Chris Himmelheber, MD, Killeen Otolaryngologist)<br />
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5391" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><meta itemprop="width" content="200"><meta itemprop="height" content="133"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Before-And-After-Lifestyle-Lift-Image-200x133.jpg" alt="Before And After Lifestyle Lift Image" width="200" height="133" class="size-medium wp-image-5391" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Before And After Lifestyle Lift Image</p></div>The cost of a Lifestylelift should be around the mid $4,500. You are saving the thousands of dollars that anesthesia would cost at a hospital. Still you are going to get the same results as the regular facelift.</p>
<p>It depends on the concerns and findings that you have during your consultation. Depending on the type of aging that you have, you might need a limited incision lift or a full face lift to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>You may also need upper and/or lower eyelid surgery, neck liposuction added to your procedure. There is more than one Lifestyle lift option. The Lifestyle lift can be as small as a minilift and as complex as a full facelift.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to trust your surgeon and to talk to him/her during your consultation. Just ask to meet the doctor during your appointment. Many physicians advocate that Lifestyle lifts do not last.</p>
<p>This is just absurd. The Lifestyle Lift is the same as a regular facelift or a Mini-Facelift. (Gustavo A. Diaz, MD, Charlotte Facial Plastic Surgeon)<br />

<h3>Cost is Important But Not the Most Important Feature in Your decision</h3>
<p>A lifestyle lift is advertised as a 1 hour procedure performed under local anesthesia, designed to tighten your jowls and face. A lifestyle lift (as advertised and promoted) alone will not contour a heavy neck.</p>
<p>More substantial procedures are required to address a heavy neck and will take quite a bit longer than an hour. Would you like to sit still while awake for a 3-4 hour procedure? Few people would.</p>
<p><b>Anesthesia</b> &#8211; Is Anesthesia a bad thing? If you are a brittle diabetic with coronary artery disease and chest pain, clearly Anesthesia is not for you. If you are a healthy person who has received medical clearance under Anesthesia, ekg, and bloodwork, chances are you will do just fine.<br />

<p>This technique is very safe is very similar to what one receives during colonoscopy. </p>
<p>Ask yourself this question: Do you really want to be aware of what is going on during a procedure? My impression is that for the vast majority of patients I have seen, Anesthesia is a blessing because it relieves anxiety and discomfort in a very safe fashion.</p>
<p><b>History</b> &#8211; Facelift was 1st described in 1911 as a short incision procedure. A lifestyle lift is a short incision facelift. There are obviously reasons why more substantial procedures were developed. The rational is simple: short incision facelifts are most appropriate for patients with minimal indications.</p>
<p>Patients with severe skin laxity, a heavy neck, cervical obliquity, and/or severe jowls will require a more extended facelift procedure.<br />

<p>Are you being recruited for a procedure by a Board Certified Facial Plastic Surgeon or Plastic Surgeon or a marketing/sales representative? Most ethical Board Certified Facial Plastic Surgeons or Plastic Surgeons will not provide guarantees for their work, because Medicine and Surgery have some degree of variability in outcomes.</p>
<p>Likewise, most ethical Surgeons will not accept patients for a procedure if the patient has the wrong indications. However, if you are being sold a procedure by a marketing/sales representative, can you be sure your indications are correct for the procedure? Remember that it is your face.</p>
<p><b>Follow Up</b> &#8211; Most Board Certified Facial Plastic Surgeons or Plastic Surgeons have a very vested interest in your outcome. They are generally working to build or maintain an excellent reputation and hold a great deal of pride in their work.<br />

<p>It is unlikely (but not impossible) that most well qualified Board Certified Facial Plastic Surgeons or Plastic Surgeons will view an opportunity such as working for lifestyle lift as a career move. Cost Review all of the factors above first, then consider the cost.</p>

<h5>Lifestyle lift price can end-up being a great deal more than a regular face lift!</h5>
<p>It can end-up costing a great deal more than a regular face lift! By that I mean there have been a few instances when a Lifestyle lift has left significant scarring and earlobe deformity, which required additional surgery and scar revision.</p>
<p>When all was set and done the patients ended up spending close to $20,000. I agree with others&#8217; comments that you get what you pay for. There is a reason why Lifestyle lift users are less than half as likely to feel that the procedure was worth it. (Sam Naficy, MD, FACS, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p><em>Regarding the cost of a Lifestyle Lift, you get what you pay for</em></p>
<p>In my experience, the patients I have seen who have had the lifestyle lift had a result that lasted for less than a year. They were not happy and felt that they still needed more surgery.<br />

(William B. Rosenblatt, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p><strong>Caution with the Lifestyle Lift: One Size Does Not Fit All</strong></p>
<p>For our patients seeking facial rejuvenation we provide a tailored approach for each individual. In general a treatment plan may consist of topical skin care, laser treatments, injections, and finally surgery. We do not believe the each patient would benefit from a standard facelift, and in fact many patients obtain excellent, long lasting results from minimally invasive treatments.</p>
<p>Some patients do require surgery, but their operation is planned according the their specific goals and desires. A browlift, blepharoplasty, midface lift, or necklift maybe necessary or a combination of the four. (Neil J. Zemmel, MD, FACS, Richmond Plastic Surgeon)<br />

<p>A major attraction of these &#8220;mini&#8221; procedures is that they don&#8217;t cost much &#8211; but be aware that revisional surgical procedures used to correct any problems from these procedures are going to be much more expensive than a well executed primary operation. (Michael A. Bogdan, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h4>I believe the cost of life style lift is determined by the corporation and is standard</h4>
<p>As with any other surgical procedure one needs to research both the procedure and the surgeon. It may best to contact several patients who are at least 6 months after their lift to see if the procedure was effective. (Amir Moradi, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p><strong>Lifts are not equal</strong></p>
<p>Be wary of trademarked big chain slickly marketed procedures. The satisfaction ratings on this website speak volumes about this procedure (low 40%). This is a difficult topic for a patient sort out through web research. My advice would be to seek a couple of reputable surgeons in your community and discuss the various options.<br />

<h4>Be very very careful&#8230;.</h4>
<p>Many of us have seen nightmares with the Lifestyle lift. As far as I can determine, it is not an operation but a marketing campaign. They seem to sell the inquiries to a list of surgeons who operate at a cut rate (no pun intended.). (John P. Di Saia, MD, Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>I would caution you to avoid surgical procedures with a &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; techniques. A facelift procedure, whether is is a &#8220;mini&#8221; or traditional lift requires years of training and experience.</p>
<p>There is a reason why you will be hard pressed to find ANY board certified plastic surgeons performing the &#8220;lifestyle lift&#8221;.<br />

When a surgeon is fully trained, he/she can design your best plan, and not use the same procedure for each patient.</p>
<p>Also, your surgeon would be able to address and fix any possible complications that may arise. As far as cost, you do get what you pay for. Be diligent and check the credentials of the physician who is performing surgery on your face. (David Rankin, MD, Jupiter Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle Lift price may be high</strong></p>
<p>A lifestyle lift or any of these marketed terms are ways for patients to be lured in to have surgery. Some surgeons performing these operations are not board certified plastic surgeons. Therefore, they do not have the same training and may not have the expertise to give you a good and safe result.<br />

<p><strong>Cost of lifestyle lift &#8230;the quality remains when the price is long forgotten</strong></p>
<p>I feel you definitely get a facelift for cheap but all the qualities you want out of a facelift are not there. The experience, the longevity , the result. The revision you may need for scarring from another doctor must be added in.</p>
<p>Do you want to be awake when they are doing your procedure it isnt getting a filling in the dentists office its a major procedure if done right and lifestyle lift isn&#8217;t in my opinion. (Richard Ellenbogen, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>The Lifestyle Lift is a trademark that generally refers to a lower face lift. The lift is usually performed using one of the most traditional techniques in facelifting. This technique is imbrication or plication of the SMAS.</p>
<p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5419" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Lifestyle-Lift-Photos-Before-After.jpg"><meta itemprop="width" content="200"><meta itemprop="height" content="136"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Lifestyle-Lift-Photos-Before-After-200x136.jpg" alt="Lifestyle Lift Photos Before After" width="200" height="136" class="size-medium wp-image-5419" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lifestyle Lift Photos Before After</p></div>This means that the muscle in the face is either cut, lifted, and sutured, or folded on itself and sutured. The result is that jowling and laxity in the neck can be addressed resulting in a more youthful look.</p>
<p>The Lifestyle Lift is done using local anesthetic. This is not a new technique. Many surgeons are skilled doing facial rejuvination procedures under local anesthetic, especially with the developent of tumescent anesthetic techniques. The difference with Lifestyle Lift is that they have developed a corporate business model that allows them to mass market in a way that has not been done before.</p>
<p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5418" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 146px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Before-And-After-Lifestyle-Lift-Procedure-Photos.jpg"><meta itemprop="width" content="136"><meta itemprop="height" content="200"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Before-And-After-Lifestyle-Lift-Procedure-Photos-136x200.jpg" alt="Before And After Lifestyle Lift Procedure Photos" width="136" height="200" class="size-medium wp-image-5418" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Before And After Lifestyle Lift Procedure Photos</p></div>The result is that they have introduced facial rejuvination surgery at a lower price point which makes it available to a greater number of people. The problem with the mass marketing done by Lifestyle Lift is that it can be deceiving. A facelift usually takes more than an hour, and the recovery takes more than a couple of days. Many people are not good candidates to have a facelift under local anesthetic. </p>
<p>The business model does not allow for deviation from the standard procedure that the perform.</p>
<p>The result is that everybody gets the same surgery regardless of what is needed. I would take your time and do multiple consultations with experienced and qualified surgeons. Most private practice surgeons do a better job of personalizing your experience and addressing all of your concerns.</p>
<p>The experience is usually much better. The price may be a little more but it is definitely worth it. (Todd C. Miller, MD, Newport Beach Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>The Lifestyle Lift is a trademarked procedure used to lift faces in the office based setting. Typically, Lifestyle Lift patients can save money by having the procedure done since it is office based rather than in the operating room.</p>
<p>The Lifestyle Lift does not address the neck unless there is extra procedures added such as neck liposuction or neck band tightening. Typically a procedure with Lifestyle Lift with neck liposuction and neck band tightening around $6000.</p>
<p>The minilift, which Lifestyle Lift is a type of, has risen in popularity and can be performed in an office setting. Every facelift surgeon has nuances and different techniques which they can utilize to ensure the best results.<br />

It is important to note that although cost is a consideration for some patients, it is often better to spend a little more and have a more desirable result than to try and save and have less than desirable results. (Anil R. Shah, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>The standard Lifestyle Lift cost ~$8,000 at this time. Care credit offers financing. The cost for a lifestyle lift is slightly less than the private practice setting. (Justin Yovino, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>The Lifestyle Lift is company that has trademarked a term and hires doctors to preform the short scar face lift they termed Lifestyle Lift. Face lift techniques have evolved to have shorter scars with quicker recovery time and don&#8217;t need to come from a company, that may or may not have board certified plastic surgeons performing the procedures.</p>
<p>A board certified plastic surgeon with experience in face lifts will be able to tailor a face lift to suits a persons specific needs. Usually 2-4 hours with local anesthesia with or without light sedation is needed.</p>
<p>Combination eyelid lift, fat injections, dermal fillers, botox and chemical peels can give a person an amazing result. (Alfred Sofer, MD, FACS, Fairfield Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>The cost of a lift is currently about $7,000 to $8,000. It depends on where you have it done. Lifestyle lift is a marketing corporation that sells facelift in many cities. The cost varies from city to city. They have some qualified physicians as well as some rookie physicians working there. In general quantity usually prevails over quality.</p>

<p> In our practice we perform a comprehensive face and neck lift which involves more than just a mini lift. It involves tightening the neck muscles in 3 locations, tightening the SMAS and jowls, tightening loose facial and neck skin, and removal of fat above and below the platysma muscle in the neck. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Usually the procedure can cost anywhere from $5000.00 &#8211; $7000.00. If you add on other procedures such as laser skin resurfacing or upper and lower eyelid procedures the cost can get higher. In my practice, I perform the &#8220;Rejuvelift&#8221;&#8230;which is a facelift that will improve the jowls and sagging neck. Often patients add on fat transfer to improve mid face fullness. The cost of the Rejuvelift runs about five to seven thousand dollars including the fat transfer. (Louis C. Cutolo, Jr., MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)<br />

<h3>Lifestyle Lift not recommended </h3>
<p>I personally do not recommend the procedure I think there is nothing like going through with a traditional technique that has worked for years and has had long lasting results , where the patient stays under observation from a well trained nurse through out the night being that the face is such a delicate place to have surgery it is important to keep a close eye just incase , and with the lifestyle procedure you leave the same day.</p>
<p>I consider you should be very careful in who you trust to do these type of procedures that are so delicate any one can do the Life Style Lift, but only a board certified doctor can to a traditional Face Lift.</p>
<p>So in other words I do not recommend the Lifestyle Lift, so far most patients that have gone through the LSL procedure are unsatisfied. , Regards !. (Luis Suarez, MD, Mexico Plastic Surgeon)<br />
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_5409" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><meta itemprop="width" content="200"><meta itemprop="height" content="200"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Lifting-The-Cheeks-200x200.jpg" alt="Lifting The Cheeks" width="200" height="200" class="size-medium wp-image-5409" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Lifting The Cheeks</p></div>In my office the &#8220;Uplift&#8221; procedure costs about $5000. This is about half the cost of our traditional facelift procedure. We offer this price because of the shorter duration of operating time and the use of oral sedation and local anesthesia; avoiding the need to have an anesthetist present and its added cost.</p>
<p>Considering the degree of improvement that can be accomplished with this procedure it is by far the safest and best value we have to offer our patients. We use the term &#8220;uplift&#8221; in our office to distinguish the procedure from our traditional face lift and also for the ease of marketing. (Richard Galitz, MD, FACS, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p><b>De-mystifying life style lift</b></p>
<p>Life style lift is just a trademark name. The type and extent of the facelift a surgeon performs is individual. As a patient you should seek out a surgeon who has specialty training and experience in facelifting in order to achieve the best possible result.</p>
<p>Your doctor will be able to explain the differences between &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; and &#8220;mini&#8221; and other buzzword that make your decision more difficult. The cost is also highly variable. In our practice a facelifting procedure can range from $5000 to about $12000, depending on a host of factors.</p>
<p>We work with several finance companies that offer a series of payment plans. (Marcelo Ghersi, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>The lifestyle lift as advertised is a trademarked minifacelift. It is a specific procedure meant to address specific concerns such as mild neck sagging and mild jowling. Mini-facelifts are wonderful for women who have just started seeing changes in their facial appearance especially along the jaw and neckline but many women need much more.</p>
<p>The key is to make sure you see someone who does both mini-facelifts, or a variation of the lifestyle lift, and full facelifts to make sure you know what you need exactly. If you go to a practice that only performs minifacelifts, then obviously they will recommend a minifacelift.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, you do get what you pay for. Minifacelifts in Atlanta range from $4500-8000 depending on the surgeon&#8217;s experience, education and training, revision rate, anesthesia cost, and specialization. (Mike Majmundar, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t bargain shop when choosing someone for a facelift. Find the best board-certified plastic or facial plastic surgeon you can in your area and have them discuss your options with you. (Jason J. Hall, MD, FACS, Knoxville Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>The best way to find out is simply to give them a call. That being said RealSelf has a forum section and they listed $6,177 average price for Lifestyle Lift in Orange County, California but I suspect it varies based on number of procedures done at the same time and perhaps geographically.</p>
<p>Please be careful as cost is measured in more than just dollars especially if you do not get the results you planned on. It might be wise to check reviews to see others&#8217; experience &#8211; for example their is a review section from former patients on RealSelf. (Larry S.

Although Lifestyle lift has closed, there were many excellent surgeons who performed thousands of procedures and were very good at what they did and are still around.</p>
<p>That was my experience. The cost of my procedure is very comparable to the old Lifestyle Lift prices. However, I perform the equivalent of a traditional facelift for that price. The price range might vary from $6500-9300, which does not include ancillary procedures such as Eye-lid surgery, laser, or fat grafting. (Brian K.

<p>As of March 27, 2015, Lifestyle Lift filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. Prior to that the average price for the lower face lift, neck liposuction, and tightening of the muscles of the neck (the platysma muscles), was $7200.00-$8200.00. </p>
<p>The lifts were done under local anesthesia with light oral sedation. If general anesthesia was required, additional fees were charged to cover the anesthesiologist and the surgery center fees. (John A. Standefer Jr., MD, FACS, Dallas Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
