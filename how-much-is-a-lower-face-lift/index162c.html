<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Costs for a lower facelift will certainly vary depending on your location.</p><p>Things to factor in for the procedure standpoint will be the facility fee, anesthesia fee, surgeon fee, other fees (e.g., liposuction, surgical garment, addition of other surgical procedures, etc.).</p><p>A range in price ~$8000-25000 is not unreasonable. (Lewis Albert Andres, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are many variables when factoring the cost of a lower facelift. The complexity of the surgery and the included components, the credentials of your board certified plastic surgeon, the use of local or general anesthetic, and finally the geographical location of your surgeon.</p><p>Our average lower facelift can range from mid $5000 to mid $10,000. Cost should never be the first factor in your choice. You must consult with a board certified plastic surgeon in order to ensure you will achieve the results you desire.

</div><p><b>The expected range will be from $7000 – $20,000</b>. This will vary greatly depending on the complexity, experience and training of the surgeon, and geographical location. For example are we talking about a American Board of Plastic Surgery certified doctor who has done hundreds of these procedures or a dermatologist or oral surgeon who has not undergone a formal residency/fellowship.</p><p>Is just a simple skin re-draping being done or neck muscle tightening, platysmaplasty, liposuction, submandibular gland reduction, chin augmentation, fat grafting to hollow areas, etc? There are a number of variables that may effect the complexity and cost of a lower face lift.</p><p>For example: Is there significant muscle laxity and banding? Is there deep neck fat? Does the chin need to be augmented? Do the submandibular glands need to be trimmed? Is there a need for fat grafting to the face?</p><p>Will this be done under general anesthesia by an anesthesiologist in a certified surgery center of in the office under local anesthesia? On the other hand the charges for similar procedures on the west coast are much higher in Beverly Hills than Orange County.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4730" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-992609270e15a3489b1d710341d52188">

</div><p>For example, as a former professor of plastic surgery at a major institution, most of the plastic surgeons I have trained charge more than me because of geographical distribution, Bottom line: compare apples to apples, in many cases you get what you pay for, and do your homework. (Larry S. Nichter, MD, MS, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The price of the surgery will vary depending in the city that the surgeon practices, the experience and credential of the surgeon and where the surgery is perform. No necessary the best surgeons or most experience are the most expensive.</p><p>What I will recommend is to chose a Boar Certified Plastic Surgeons and a Accredited Medical Facility.</p><h3>This varies by who, where and how much is done.</h3><ul>
<li>
<strong>Who</strong>: How long the surgeon has been doing the procedure</li>
<li>
<strong>Where</strong>: Which city, similar to how rent and housing differ</li>
<li>
<strong>How much is done</strong>: If a neck lift is included, if laser is used superficially, if botox is applied.</li>

</div><p>My prices vary from 7K to 11K without general anesthesia. General Anesthesia adds 3.5K to the treatment if the patient selects that route. (Benjamin Caughlin, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of the lower facelift is dependent upon 3 factors. These 3 factors are doctors fee, anesthesia doctors fee, and the operating room fee. It is always best choose quality over price, since this is your face and it’s important to get it done right the first time.</p><p>For many examples of what her facelift can accomplish, please see the leak below to our photo Gallery. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Cost of Lower Facelift in Atlanta</strong></p><p>The cost of a facelift depends on the geographic location, the type of facelift needed, your surgeon’s credentials, his/her revision rate, and your surgeon’s experience and reputation.</p><p>Facelifts can range from $4500-$20,000. Not all facelifts are the same and every person has a different facial anatomy and the approach for a facelift has to be individualized.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4732" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Asking to look at before and after photos may give you an idea of the surgeon’s aesthetic judgement and how natural his or her facelift results are. Picking the right surgeon the first time around is worth the cost of a well performed facelift instead of a revision.</p><p>For Example, we specialize in Natural Facial Plastic Procedures such as our Natural Facelift and Natural Necklift to provide patients with a natural appearance to their face after surgery. Though our facelift costs are similar to others in our area, we provide and offer different types of lifts than they do. (Mike Majmundar, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are a number of variables that may effect the complexity and cost of a lower face lift.</p><p>For example: Is there significant muscle laxity and banding? Is there deep neck fat? Does the chin need to be augmented? Do the submandibular glands need to be trimmed? Is there a need for fat grafting to the face?

</div><h4>Lower Facelift Fees</h4><p>The fees for a lower Facelift will vary based on a number of factors including geographical location, skill of the surgeon, the amount of time needed to perform the procedure, just to name a few.</p><p>I would expect the fees for a standard lower Facelift to range between $7000 and $9000 in the Midwest. Contact some reputable surgeons in your geographical area ( I recommend a surgeon Board Certified by the AAFPRS). (Michael Sullivan, MD, Columbus Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A lower facelift addresses: the temple, cheek, jowl, and neck areas. This surgical procedure fee will vary from one surgeon to the next and from region to region. This may be between $6000 to $15000. (Carlos Cordoba, MD, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Lower facelift addresses the neck and jowls and area around the mouth. Typical costs are 10 k for everything included. (Robert M. Freund, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4734" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>A lower facelift surgical procedure fee will vary from one region to the next. In NYC this may be between $8-12000. But that is a rough ballpark. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Facelift cost depends on your anatomy</h4><p>The cost of a facelift depends on your specific anatomy. Be careful about bargain hunting when it comes to your face. I have taken care of many people who had bad facelift outcomes when they didn’t know their surgeon and went with a given doc just based on price.</p><p>You have one face and you can’t hide a bad result. (Jason B. Diamond, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Facelifts do vary by experience, degree of lift and the cost of a home in your area. In SC as a boarded surgeon, my office based lifts with limited anesthesia begin at $5400 and at a surgery center with MD anesthesia at over $8300. (J. Smythe Rich, MD, Columbia Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4735" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><h5>Multiple factors affect cost</h5><p>There is a wide range of costs for a lower face lift. Variables include the degree of laxity of the skin and muscles in your neck, prior surgeries which may either complicate the surgery or make it easier, male or female, the degree of correction desired, the use of a surgery center and anesthesia, the geographic location of the doctor, and whether other procedures such as eyelid surgery or fat transfer or added at the same time.</p><p>For a lower facelift alone on an “average” 50 year old woman ranges in my area (beverly hills) from about $5000 to $15000. Of course, you do have to take into consideration the skill and experience of the surgeon, results, patient and doctor recommendations, etc.</p><p>Almost half of my patients have had surgery elsewhere that they have not been happy with, and then they have the added expense of revision surgery. It goes without saying that it’s better to get it right the first time.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4736" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>You are smart to do your research on websites such as this. (Jonathan Hoenig, MD, Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>The price for lower face lift will vary widely depending on the surgeon, the extent of work necessary, and area of the country and city you live in. In our office it may range from $4500 to $8500. (Stella Desyatnikova, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Lower facelift costs and options, including Ultherapy in Santa Monica</i></p><p>Facelift methods vary greatly, so a comparison of costs is difficult as you may be comparing apples or oranges. Ultherapy is one option should you desire a non surgical and less costly mini lift. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of a lower face lift varies depending on your geographical location. It is best to get several quotes from well qualified surgeons in your area. Don’t use the cost alone to determine your choice.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4737" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I have seen some less than pleasing face lift results when money alone was the deciding factor. Face lift fees can range from $9,000 to $35,000. (David Alessi, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A “facelift” is like saying “car”. Are we talking about a Pinto or a Rolls? The answer to your needs will be based on the amount of work to be done and the quality of the surgeons skills.</p><p>Look at before and after photos and meet with the doctor’s patients to actually see what he does! Seek out several reputable surgeons in your area and select one with YOUR GOALS in mind, not his. (Toby Mayer, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
