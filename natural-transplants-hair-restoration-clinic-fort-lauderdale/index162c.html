<div class="fullTableRow">
<div class="fullTableCell"> Uneven hairline around the side. Could this be fixed?</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Uneven Hairline<br><i>Apr 29, 2022</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Thank you for your question. The hairline can be transplanted to even out any inherent unevenness along the temporal edges. The beauty of the transplant is that the new hairs can be designed to blend in with your existing hairline and achieve a natural look. Once the hairs have been transplanted and matured (typically at 12 months), the hairs can be styled and cropped. The hairs can be cut or cropped earlier, but they may appear less dense until the 12 month mark.</div>
</div>
<div class="fullTableRow">
<div class="fullTableCell"> Will I still get new hair growth 8-10 months post-op?</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Hair Growth 8-10 months Post Op<br><i>Apr 29, 2022</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Thank you for your question. Each patient varies, however there is definitely still growth from 8-10 months post-op. Typically, a good gauge of the density can be appreciated at about the 9month mark. The final result isn’t truly appreciated until 12 months. Certain areas such as the crown, tend to take a little longer and can be up to 18 months. The best way to appreciate the progress is to take photos in the same location every month.</div>
</div>
<div class="fullTableRow">
<div class="fullTableCell"> Can I keep minoxidil on all day/week?</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Minoxidil and Washing<br><i>Apr 29, 2022</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Thank you for your question regarding Minoxidil. It is not advised to keep Minoxidil on all week. Generally, it is best to wash your hair regularly, at least every other day on Minoxidil (Don’t wash for at least 4 hours after application).</div>
</div>
<div class="fullTableRow">
<div class="fullTableCell"> Want more density: whould I do a 2nd Hair transplant or Micropigmentation? </div>
<div class="fullTableCell">10 Month Result<br><i>Apr 29, 2022</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Thank you for sharing your photos. The result looks on track for 10 months and the final result won’t be appreciated until the full 12 months. Before making any decisions, it’s advised to wait for the final density. There still will be more maturing and density in the next few months. Given the fact that you have dark hair on lighter skin background, micropigmentation may be a great adjunct to the transplant.</div>
</div>
<div class="fullTableRow">
<div class="fullTableCell"> Is this early baldness and do I need a Hair Transplant? </div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Early Baldness<br><i>Apr 29, 2022</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Thank you for the photos. You definitely have good quality hair and may be experiencing the very beginnings of Male Pattern Baldness. The term describes a “pattern” and typically males will have receding of the hairline and/or the lateral recessions (corners) that you are depicting in the pictures. It appears to be very early in the process. In your case, it may be advised to wait until there is more area to transplant before undergoing a procedure. For small cases, DHI (FUE) may be…</div>
